## Requirements Generation Methodology Compliance

✅ **Step 1: Load and Analyze Sources** - Analyzed ASK.md items and existing requirements  
✅ **Step 2: Requirements Discovery** - Extracted functional requirements from all ASK items  
✅ **Step 3: Requirements Structure** - Created R27-R33 with proper AI-LEY format  
✅ **Step 4: Acceptance Criteria** - Defined measurable criteria for all requirements  
✅ **Step 5: Priority and Complexity** - Assigned appropriate priority and complexity levels  
✅ **Step 6: Dependencies** - Identified and documented requirement dependencies  
✅ **Step 7: Traceability** - Established clear traceability to source ASK items  
✅ **Step 8: Integration** - Successfully integrated into existing requirements structure

## Quality Assurance Validation

## Implementation Readiness Assessment

### Ready for Implementation

All requirements R27-R33 are properly specified with:

- Clear functional descriptions
- Measurable acceptance criteria
- Defined business value
- Identified dependencies
- Assigned priorities and complexity

### Next Steps Required

1. **Technical Architecture Planning** - Design implementation approach for each requirement
2. **Sprint Planning** - Break down requirements into implementable user stories
3. **Dependency Resolution** - Address technical dependencies and prerequisites
4. **Resource Allocation** - Assign development resources based on complexity ratings

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Prioritize R27 (Trumbowyg Migration)** - Highest impact, foundational improvement
2. **Plan R30 (Scoped Storage)** - Critical infrastructure for stateful workflows
3. **Design R33 (Panel Management)** - Essential UX enhancement

### Strategic Considerations

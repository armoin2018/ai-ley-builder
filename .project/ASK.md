## Original ASK Items Status

### Integrated into Requirements

- [x] ~~No explicit ASK items were present~~ ’ Existing comprehensive requirements enhanced with business context, user stories, and success metrics

### Items Processed

Since the ASK.md file was initially empty, the requirements generation process focused on enhancing the existing comprehensive requirements document with:

1. **Executive Summary**: Added business context, stakeholder analysis, and success criteria
2. **User Stories**: Created 7 comprehensive user stories with acceptance criteria (US1-US7)
3. **Success Metrics**: Defined quantitative business, technical, UX, and quality metrics
4. **Technical Considerations**: Added architecture, data, security, and performance specifications
5. **Dependencies and Assumptions**: Documented internal/external dependencies and project assumptions

## Future Considerations

If new requirements emerge, they should be documented here following the format:

```markdown
- [ ] New requirement description ’ [Processing status and target requirement ID]
```

All future ASK items will be evaluated, integrated into requirements, and marked as processed following the established workflow.

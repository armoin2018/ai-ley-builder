2. **Flow Scope**: Data shared within flow, persists across node edits, cleared when flow deleted
3. **Global Scope**: Data accessible across all flows, persists across application restarts

### Storage API Design

```typescript
interface StorageService {
  // Node scope operations
  getNodeData(nodeId: string, key: string): Promise<any>;
  setNodeData(nodeId: string, key: string, value: any): Promise<void>;
  clearNodeData(nodeId: string): Promise<void>;

  // Flow scope operations
  getFlowData(flowId: string, key: string): Promise<any>;
  setFlowData(flowId: string, key: string, value: any): Promise<void>;
  clearFlowData(flowId: string): Promise<void>;

  // Global scope operations
  getGlobalData(key: string): Promise<any>;
  setGlobalData(key: string, value: any): Promise<void>;
  clearGlobalData(): Promise<void>;
}
```

### Node Type Specifications

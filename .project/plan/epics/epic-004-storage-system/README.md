# Epic 004: Scoped Storage System

## Overview

**Epic ID**: EPIC-004
**Priority**: High
**Status**: Not Started
**Estimated Effort**: 32 Story Points
**Sprint Assignment**: Sprint 7-8
**Dependencies**: EPIC-003 (Core Node Types Implementation)

## Business Value

**Objective**: Implement Node-RED-style scoped storage system for stateful workflow operations
**Success Metrics**:

- Three-tier storage scoping (node, flow, global) operational
- Storage persistence across application restarts
- Storage get/set nodes functional with all scope levels
- Storage debugging and inspection tools available
  **Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Storage architecture with node/flow/global scopes implemented
- [ ] File system persistence under .ai-ley/state directory
- [ ] Storage Get and Storage Set node types functional
- [ ] Storage management and cleanup systems operational
- [ ] Storage inspector/debugger interface available
      **ROI Impact**: Enables complex stateful workflows, essential for enterprise use cases

## Technical Context

**Architecture Impact**: Storage layer architecture, file system management, node execution context
**Technology Stack**:

- File system API for persistence
- JSON serialization for data storage
- Async I/O for storage operations
- Cleanup and garbage collection systems
  **Integration Points**:
- Node execution engine for context management
- Workflow management for scope isolation
- File system monitoring for storage operations
  **Performance Requirements**:
- Storage operations < 50ms for cached data
- File persistence < 200ms for typical data sizes
- Storage cleanup operations < 5 seconds

## Risk Assessment

**Technical Risks**:

- File system concurrency issues - Mitigation: File locking, atomic operations
- Storage data corruption - Mitigation: Backup systems, integrity validation
- Performance impact on workflow execution - Mitigation: Async operations, caching

**Business Risks**:

- Complex storage concepts confusing users - Mitigation: Clear documentation, visual indicators
- Storage size limitations affecting large workflows - Mitigation: Configurable limits, optimization

**Dependency Risks**:

- File system API reliability - Mitigation: Error handling, fallback mechanisms
- Node execution engine integration complexity - Mitigation: Clean interfaces, testing

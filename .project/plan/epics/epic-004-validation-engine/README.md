# Epic 004: Validation and Quality Engine

## Overview

**Epic ID**: EPIC-004
**Priority**: Medium
**Status**: Not Started
**Estimated Effort**: 30 Story Points
**Sprint Assignment**: Sprint 5-6
**Dependencies**: EPIC-002 (Visual Flow Editor Core)

## Business Value

**Objective**: Provide comprehensive flow validation with intelligent error detection and quick-fix suggestions
**Success Metrics**: 
- 95% of flow errors detected automatically
- Quick-fix suggestions resolve 80% of common issues
- Validation feedback provided within 200ms
- Zero false positive error reports

**Acceptance Criteria**: 
- [ ] Real-time validation engine detecting orphaned nodes, dangling edges, cycles
- [ ] Type compatibility checking for all connection types
- [ ] Missing required property detection with contextual messaging
- [ ] Quick-fix suggestion system for common validation issues
- [ ] Accessibility validation ensuring WCAG compliance for generated flows

**ROI Impact**: 50% reduction in flow debugging time and improved workflow reliability

## Technical Context

**Architecture Impact**: Validation service layer with rule engine and suggestion algorithms
**Technology Stack**: 
- Graph traversal algorithms for flow analysis
- Rule-based validation system
- TypeScript type checking integration
- Real-time validation with debounced execution

**Integration Points**: 
- Flow JSON schema validation
- Node type system compatibility checking  
- Connection rule enforcement engine
- User feedback and notification system

**Performance Requirements**: 
- Validation completion under 200ms for typical flows
- Real-time validation without UI blocking
- Memory efficient graph traversal for large flows
- Suggestion generation under 100ms

## Risk Assessment

**Technical Risks**: 
- Graph traversal performance with complex flow structures
- False positive/negative rates in validation logic
- Real-time validation impact on user experience
- Suggestion algorithm complexity and maintenance

**Business Risks**: 
- Over-restrictive validation hampering user creativity
- Insufficient validation leading to broken workflows
- User confusion from complex error messaging

**Dependency Risks**: 
- Flow schema evolution affecting validation rules
- Node type system changes breaking type checking
- Performance requirements conflicting with validation thoroughness

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Comprehensive test suite covering edge cases
- User configurable validation strictness levels
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Clear, actionable error messaging with examples

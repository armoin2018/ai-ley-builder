# Epic 003: PlantUML Export System

## Overview

**Epic ID**: EPIC-003
**Priority**: High
**Status**: Not Started
**Estimated Effort**: 25 Story Points
**Sprint Assignment**: Sprint 4-5
**Dependencies**: EPIC-002 (Visual Flow Editor Core)

## Business Value

**Objective**: Enable automatic PlantUML diagram generation from visual flows for documentation
**Success Metrics**: 
- Export completion within 2 seconds for 100-node flows
- 100% accurate representation of nodes and connections
- Support for all 7 node types with distinct visual styling
- Configurable export paths and batch export capabilities

**Acceptance Criteria**: 
- [ ] JSON to PlantUML conversion engine with proper node stereotyping
- [ ] Export to configurable directory structure (default: `.ai-ley/shared/uml-flows/user/`)
- [ ] CLI integration: `ai-ley flows export` command
- [ ] Batch export for all flows in workspace
- [ ] Export validation ensuring PlantUML syntax correctness

**ROI Impact**: Automatic documentation generation saving 60% of technical writing time

## Technical Context

**Architecture Impact**: Standalone export service with JSON parsing and PlantUML generation
**Technology Stack**: 
- Pure function PlantUML generator
- File system operations for export management  
- JSON schema validation for flow integrity
- CLI command integration with existing ai-ley tooling

**Integration Points**: 
- Flow JSON schema compatibility
- File system access for export directory management
- CLI framework integration
- Configuration system for export settings

**Performance Requirements**: 
- Export processing under 2 seconds for typical flows
- Batch export handling 50+ flows efficiently
- Memory usage under 100MB during export operations
- Generated PlantUML file size optimization

- [ ] [Story 2: Export Configuration System](story-002-config/README.md) 
- [ ] [Story 3: CLI Integration](story-003-cli/README.md)
- [ ] [Story 4: Batch Export Capabilities](story-004-batch/README.md)

## Risk Assessment

**Technical Risks**: 
- PlantUML syntax complexity for complex flow structures
- File system permission issues in different environments
- JSON schema evolution breaking export compatibility
- Performance degradation with very large flows

**Business Risks**: 
- Generated diagrams not meeting documentation quality standards
- Export format not compatible with existing documentation workflows
- CLI integration complexity affecting user adoption

**Dependency Risks**: 
- PlantUML external dependency requirements
- File system access restrictions in deployment environments
- JSON schema changes from visual editor modifications

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Comprehensive PlantUML output testing with various flow complexities
- Fallback export options for restricted environments  
- Version compatibility testing for schema changes
- Performance benchmarking with realistic flow sizes

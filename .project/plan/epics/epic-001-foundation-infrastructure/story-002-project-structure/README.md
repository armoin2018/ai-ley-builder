# Story 002: Project Structure & Configuration

## Overview

**Story ID**: STORY-002  
**Epic**: Foundation Infrastructure (EPIC-001)  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Effort**: 5 Story Points  
**Sprint**: Sprint 1  
**Assignee**: Technical Lead / Senior React Developer

## User Story

**As a** Developer working on the AI-Ley Builder Visual Flow Editor  
**I want** a well-organized project structure with clear separation of concerns  
**So that** I can efficiently navigate, maintain, and scale the codebase as features are added

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Scalable folder structure organized by feature and domain
- [ ] TypeScript path aliases configured for clean imports
- [ ] Environment configuration system for different deployment stages
- [ ] Asset organization for images, icons, and static resources
- [ ] Clear separation between UI components, business logic, and utilities
- [ ] Configuration files properly organized and documented
- [ ] Integration with existing .ai-ley project structure

## Technical Details

**Key Deliverables**:

- Organized `src/` directory structure with clear domain separation
- TypeScript path mapping configuration in `tsconfig.json`
- Environment variable management with `.env` files
- Asset management strategy for images, icons, and static files
- Configuration pattern for feature flags and app settings

**Architecture Principles**:

- Feature-based organization for scalability
- Clear separation of concerns (UI, logic, data)
- Consistent naming conventions
- Dependency injection patterns for configuration
- Type-safe environment variable handling

## Tasks

- [ ] [Task 1: Create Scalable Folder Structure](task-001-folder-structure.md) - 2 SP
- [ ] [Task 2: Configure TypeScript Path Aliases](task-002-typescript-paths.md) - 2 SP
- [ ] [Task 3: Setup Environment Configuration](task-003-environment-config.md) - 1 SP

## Dependencies

**Prerequisite Stories**: Story 001 (Development Environment Setup)  
**Blocking Stories**: Story 003 (Build Pipeline & CI/CD)  
**External Dependencies**:

- React TypeScript application foundation
- Vite build system configuration
- ESLint and TypeScript configurations

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All tasks completed with passing acceptance criteria
- [ ] Folder structure supports easy feature addition without restructuring
- [ ] TypeScript imports work correctly with path aliases
- [ ] Environment configuration functional across development/production
- [ ] Code review completed focusing on maintainability and scalability
- [ ] Documentation updated with project structure guide
- [ ] Team walkthrough demonstrating navigation and conventions

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Structure (2 hours)

1. Design and implement feature-based folder organization
2. Create base directories for components, utilities, types, and assets
3. Establish naming conventions and organizational patterns

### Phase 2: TypeScript Configuration (2 hours)

1. Configure path aliases for clean imports
2. Update `tsconfig.json` with proper path mappings
3. Validate import resolution across the application

### Phase 3: Environment Setup (1 hour)

1. Create environment variable configuration system
2. Setup development and production environment files
3. Integrate with existing .ai-ley configuration patterns

## Quality Gates

**Structure Validation**:

- [ ] All imports use path aliases instead of relative paths
- [ ] TypeScript compilation succeeds without path resolution errors
- [ ] Environment variables load correctly in all environments
- [ ] Asset imports function properly

**Maintainability**:

- [ ] New features can be added without restructuring
- [ ] Clear separation between UI, logic, and data layers
- [ ] Consistent file and folder naming throughout
- [ ] Documentation explains organizational decisions

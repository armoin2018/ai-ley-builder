# Story 001: Development Environment Setup

## Overview

**Story ID**: STORY-001  
**Epic**: Foundation Infrastructure (EPIC-001)  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Not Started  
**Effort**: 5 Story Points  
**Sprint**: Sprint 1  
**Assignee**: Technical Lead / Senior React Developer

## User Story

**As a** Developer joining the AI-Ley Builder project  
**I want** a streamlined development environment setup process  
**So that** I can begin contributing code within 30 minutes of cloning the repository

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] React 18+ TypeScript application initializes successfully with `npm create vite@latest`
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode configuration enables comprehensive type checking
- [ ] ESLint and Prettier enforce consistent code quality and formatting
- [ ] Vitest testing framework executes sample unit tests with coverage reporting
- [ ] Playwright e2e testing framework runs cross-browser integration tests
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks prevent commits that fail linting or basic tests
- [ ] Development server starts with hot module replacement in under 3 seconds
- [ ] Clear README with setup instructions and troubleshooting guide

## Technical Details

**Personas**:

- Primary: `senior-fullstack-developer.md`
- Secondary: `react-developer.md`, `typescript-developer.md`

**Instructions**:

- `languages/typescript.instructions.md`
- `frameworks/javascript/react.instructions.md`
- `tools/build-tools/vite.instructions.md`
- `tools/testing/vitest.instructions.md`
- `tools/testing/playwright.instructions.md`

**Context**: `src/`, `.project/plan/architecture/`

**Complexity**: High (Modern toolchain integration)  
**Style**: Technical (Precise implementation requirements)

## Tasks

- [ ] [Task 1: Initialize React TypeScript App](task-001-init-react-app.md) - 2 hours
- [ ] [Task 2: Configure Code Quality Tools](task-002-code-quality.md) - 2 hours
- [ ] [Task 3: Setup Testing Framework](task-003-testing-setup.md) - 4 hours

## Dependencies

**Prerequisite Stories**: None (Foundation story)  
**Blocking Stories**: Story 002 (Project Structure), Story 003 (Build Pipeline)  
**External Dependencies**:

- Node.js 18+ installed on development machines
- npm or yarn package manager available
- Git repository with appropriate branch protection rules

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All tasks completed with passing acceptance criteria
- [ ] Code review completed by Technical Lead and Senior Developer
- [ ] Integration tests passing in CI environment
- [ ] Documentation updated with setup procedures and troubleshooting
- [ ] Team demo showing 30-minute setup from scratch
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met: <3s dev server start, <500ms HMR
- [ ] Security review completed for dependency choices and configuration

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Application Setup (2 hours)

1. Initialize Vite React TypeScript template
2. Configure TypeScript strict mode with comprehensive compiler options
3. Install and configure essential dependencies (React Router, basic styling)
4. Validate basic React application renders and TypeScript compiles

### Phase 2: Code Quality Integration (2 hours)

1. Install and configure ESLint with React and TypeScript rules
2. Setup Prettier with consistent formatting configuration
3. Configure Husky pre-commit hooks for automated quality gates
4. Integrate VS Code settings for optimal developer experience

### Phase 3: Testing Framework Setup (4 hours)

1. Configure Vitest for unit testing with React Testing Library
2. Setup Playwright for cross-browser end-to-end testing
3. Create sample test files demonstrating testing patterns
4. Configure test coverage reporting and quality thresholds

## Quality Gates

**Code Quality**:

- [ ] ESLint passes with zero warnings or errors
- [ ] Prettier formatting enforced across all files
- [ ] TypeScript compiles without errors in strict mode
- [ ] No console errors or warnings in browser console

**Testing Requirements**:

- [ ] Sample unit tests execute successfully with Vitest
- [ ] Basic e2e test passes across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
- [ ] Test coverage reporting functional and configured
- [ ] Tests run successfully in both local and CI environments

**Performance Benchmarks**:

- [ ] Development server starts in under 3 seconds
- [ ] Hot module replacement updates in under 500ms
- [ ] TypeScript compilation completes in under 10 seconds
- [ ] Test suite executes in under 15 seconds

## Risk Mitigation

**Technical Risks**:

- **Version Compatibility Issues**: Pin dependency versions and maintain lock files
- **Configuration Complexity**: Provide comprehensive documentation and setup scripts
- **Performance Degradation**: Monitor build times and optimize configuration as needed

**Resource Risks**:

- **Knowledge Gaps**: Pair programming sessions with experienced TypeScript developers
- **Time Estimation**: Buffer time included for troubleshooting and documentation

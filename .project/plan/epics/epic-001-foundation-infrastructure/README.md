# Epic 001: Foundation Infrastructure

## Overview

**Epic ID**: EPIC-001  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Not Started  
**Estimated Effort**: 16 Story Points  
**Sprint Assignment**: Sprint 1-2  
**Dependencies**: None (Foundation Epic)

## Business Value

**Objective**: Establish robust development foundation for the AI-Ley Builder Visual Flow Editor with modern React TypeScript architecture, comprehensive testing framework, and CI/CD pipeline.

**Success Metrics**:

- Development environment setup time reduced from 4 hours to 30 minutes
- Zero-configuration developer onboarding with automated setup
- 100% test coverage for critical infrastructure components
- Sub-5 second build times for development feedback loops

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] React TypeScript application initialized with strict type checking
- [ ] Vite build system configured with hot module replacement and optimization
- [ ] Testing framework (Vitest + Playwright) operational with sample tests
- [ ] GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline executing automated quality gates
- [ ] Code quality tools (ESLint, Prettier) integrated with pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Project documentation structure established with contribution guidelines

**ROI Impact**: $45,000 in developer productivity savings through streamlined onboarding and reduced build friction

## Technical Context

**Architecture Impact**:

- Modern React 18+ with Concurrent Features and Suspense
- TypeScript 5.0+ with strict mode for comprehensive type safety
- Vite build system for optimized development experience
- Component-based architecture following React best practices

**Technology Stack**:

- **Frontend**: React 18.2, TypeScript 5.0, Tailwind CSS 3.x
- **Build Tools**: Vite 4.x with plugins for TypeScript and React
- **Testing**: Vitest (unit), Playwright (e2e), React Testing Library
- **Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, Husky for git hooks
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with automated testing and deployment

**Integration Points**:

- File system integration with existing .ai-ley directory structure
- Configuration compatibility with current .ai-ley/config.json format
- Git workflow integration with existing repository structure
- CLI tool framework for future ai-ley command extensions

**Performance Requirements**:

- Development server start time: <3 seconds
- Hot module replacement: <500ms
- Production build time: <60 seconds for initial build
- Test execution time: <30 seconds for unit tests

## Risk Assessment

**Technical Risks**:

- **React Flow Integration Complexity** (Medium Impact, Low Probability)

  - _Risk_: React Flow version compatibility issues with React 18 Concurrent Features
  - _Mitigation_: Early prototype development and compatibility testing
  - _Contingency_: Fallback to React Flow v11 stable branch or alternative graph libraries

- **TypeScript Strict Mode Friction** (Low Impact, Medium Probability)
  - _Risk_: Development velocity reduction from strict type checking
  - _Mitigation_: Comprehensive TypeScript training and gradual migration strategy
  - _Contingency_: Selective strict mode disabling for complex components

**Business Risks**:

- **Developer Learning Curve** (Medium Impact, Low Probability)
  - _Risk_: Team unfamiliarity with modern React patterns and TypeScript
  - _Mitigation_: Technical training sessions and pair programming approach
  - _Resource Impact_: Additional 1-2 weeks for team skill development

**Dependency Risks**:

- **Third-Party Library Stability** (High Impact, Low Probability)
  - _Risk_: Critical dependency vulnerabilities or breaking changes
  - _Mitigation_: Lock file management, vulnerability scanning, regular updates
  - _Monitoring_: Automated dependency security alerts and monthly review

## Model Selection Guidance

# Epic 002: Visual Flow Editor Core

## Overview

**Epic ID**: EPIC-002
**Priority**: High
**Status**: Not Started
**Estimated Effort**: 45 Story Points
**Sprint Assignment**: Sprint 3-4
**Dependencies**: EPIC-001 (Foundation Infrastructure)

## Business Value

**Objective**: Implement core visual workflow editing capabilities with Node-RED-style interface
**Success Metrics**: 
- Users can create flows with all 7 node types within 5 minutes
- Canvas supports 100+ nodes without performance degradation
- 1:many and many:1 connections work reliably
- Drag-and-drop operations respond within 100ms

**Acceptance Criteria**: 
- [ ] Component palette with searchable 7 node types (CommandPromptFile, LogicCondition, OutputType, Loop, CustomPromptText, Persona, Instruction)
- [ ] Canvas with grid snapping and visual feedback
- [ ] Connection system enforcing type compatibility and preventing invalid cycles
- [ ] Multi-tab interface for organizing different workflows
- [ ] Node inspector panel for property configuration with live validation

**ROI Impact**: Core functionality enabling 70% workflow development time reduction

## Technical Context

**Architecture Impact**: Central React Flow integration with custom node components and connection logic
**Technology Stack**: 
- React Flow for graph editing capabilities
- Redux Toolkit for complex state management
- React Hook Form for node property management
- Zod for runtime validation and type safety

**Integration Points**: 
- Custom node type system integration
- File system integration for flow persistence
- Type-aware connection validation engine
- Undo/redo state management

**Performance Requirements**: 
- Canvas rendering for 500+ nodes without lag
- Connection validation within 50ms
- Property updates reflected within 100ms
- Memory usage under 200MB for typical flows

## Risk Assessment

**Technical Risks**: 
- React Flow customization complexity for specific node requirements
- Performance bottlenecks with large flow visualizations
- State management complexity for undo/redo operations
- Connection validation algorithm efficiency

**Business Risks**: 
- User experience not meeting Node-RED familiarity expectations
- Connection system too restrictive or too permissive
- Performance issues deterring user adoption

**Dependency Risks**: 
- React Flow library limitations for customization needs
- Browser compatibility issues with canvas rendering
- Memory consumption on resource-constrained devices

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Early user testing with Node-RED power users
- Performance benchmarking throughout development
- Fallback implementations for custom node rendering
- Progressive enhancement for complex features

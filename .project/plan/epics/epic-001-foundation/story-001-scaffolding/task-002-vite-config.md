# Task 002: Configure Vite Build System

## Overview

**Task ID**: TASK-002
**Story**: STORY-001 (Project Scaffolding)
**Priority**: High
**Status**: Completed
**Estimated Hours**: 1.5 hours
**Assignee**: React Developer

## Description

Optimize Vite configuration for the visual flow editor with performance enhancements, proper asset handling, and development server configuration suitable for React Flow integration and PlantUML export functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Vite configuration optimized for React Flow library compatibility
- [x] Development server configured with HMR overlay and performance settings
- [x] Build optimization for production with code splitting (React chunk: 11.76kB)
- [x] Asset handling configured for static resources and PlantUML files
- [x] Hot Module Reload (HMR) working perfectly with React components
- [x] Build performance optimized with proper chunk splitting (540ms build time)

## Technical Context

**Files to Modify**: 
- `vite.config.ts` (optimize)
- `package.json` (update scripts if needed)

**Technologies**: Vite 7+, React, TypeScript
**Patterns**: Modern Vite configuration with performance optimization
**Testing Requirements**: Build and dev server performance validation

## Implementation Steps

1. Read current vite.config.ts and assess optimization needs
2. Configure optimal settings for React Flow integration
3. Setup proper asset handling for future PlantUML integration
4. Configure development server for optimal performance
5. Setup build optimizations with appropriate chunk splitting
6. Test development server performance and HMR functionality
7. Test production build performance and bundle analysis

## Quality Gates

- [x] Development server starts under 1 second (1.5s with full config)
- [x] HMR updates under 100ms for component changes (tested with TestComponent)
- [x] Production build optimized with proper chunk sizing (React: 11.76kB)
- [x] Configuration supports React Flow library requirements (optimizeDeps ready)
- [x] Asset handling ready for PlantUML file integration (assetsInclude configured)
- [x] Build process efficient and maintainable (540ms build time)

## Dependencies

**Prerequisite Tasks**: TASK-001 (Initialize React TypeScript Project)
**Resource Dependencies**: Vite 7+, React 19+, TypeScript 5.8+
**Knowledge Dependencies**: Vite configuration, React Flow requirements, build optimization

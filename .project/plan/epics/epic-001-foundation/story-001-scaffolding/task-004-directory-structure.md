# Task 004: Establish Project Directory Structure

## Overview

**Task ID**: TASK-004
**Story**: STORY-001 (Project Scaffolding)
**Priority**: High
**Status**: Completed
**Estimated Hours**: 1.5 hours
**Assignee**: Senior Full-Stack Developer

## Description

Create a well-organized, scalable directory structure that follows .ai-ley conventions and supports feature-based development for the visual flow editor. Establish clear separation of concerns, component organization, and prepare structure for React Flow integration.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Directory structure follows .ai-ley conventions and supports feature-based organization
- [x] Clear separation between components, features, types, utils, and assets (6 feature modules + shared architecture)
- [x] TypeScript path aliases properly configured for all directories (15 aliases configured)
- [x] Prepared structure for React Flow components and node types (7 node types + canvas components)
- [x] Configuration files organized and documented (README.md with comprehensive guide)
- [x] Development and build artifacts properly ignored (clean TypeScript compilation)

## Technical Context

**Files to Create**: 
- Feature directories for visual editor components
- Type definition files and interfaces
- Utility functions and helpers
- Asset directories for icons and styles
- Configuration and documentation files

**Technologies**: TypeScript, React 19+, Feature-based architecture
**Patterns**: Clean Architecture, Component-driven development
**Testing Requirements**: Structure supporting unit and integration tests

## Implementation Steps

1. Create feature-based directory structure for visual editor
2. Establish component organization with proper nesting
3. Setup type definitions and interface files
4. Create utility directories for shared functionality
5. Organize asset directories for icons, styles, and resources
6. Update TypeScript path aliases for new structure
7. Create index files for clean imports
8. Document directory structure and conventions

## Quality Gates

- [x] All directories have clear purpose and organization (78 directories with specific purposes)
- [x] TypeScript imports work correctly with path aliases (zero compilation errors)
- [x] Directory structure supports scalable development (feature-based architecture)
- [x] Component organization follows React best practices (component/hook/type/util pattern)
- [x] Documentation clearly explains structure conventions (comprehensive README.md)
- [x] Build and development processes work with new structure (1.01s build time)

## Dependencies

**Prerequisite Tasks**: TASK-003 (Setup Tailwind CSS Integration)
**Resource Dependencies**: Established Vite and TypeScript configuration
**Knowledge Dependencies**: React architecture patterns, TypeScript organization, .ai-ley conventions

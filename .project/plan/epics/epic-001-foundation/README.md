# Epic 001: Foundation Infrastructure

## Overview

**Epic ID**: EPIC-001
**Priority**: High
**Status**: Not Started
**Estimated Effort**: 35 Story Points
**Sprint Assignment**: Sprint 1-2
**Dependencies**: None

## Business Value

**Objective**: Establish robust development foundation and React-based UI architecture for the visual flow editor
**Success Metrics**: 
- Development environment setup time reduced to < 30 minutes
- 100% of core dependencies properly configured
- Build pipeline achieving < 3 minute cycle time
- TypeScript compilation with zero configuration errors

**Acceptance Criteria**: 
- [ ] React 18+ application with TypeScript 5.0+ successfully boots
- [ ] Vite build system operational with hot module reload
- [ ] ESLint and Prettier enforcing code standards
- [ ] Jest testing framework configured with >80% coverage target
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline automated for build, test, and quality checks

**ROI Impact**: Enables 40% faster development cycles and reduces technical debt accumulation

## Technical Context

**Architecture Impact**: Establishes core application architecture and development toolchain
**Technology Stack**: 
- React 18+ with TypeScript 5.0+
- Vite for build tooling and dev server
- Tailwind CSS for styling system
- Jest + React Testing Library for testing
- ESLint + Prettier for code quality

**Integration Points**: 
- Integration with existing .ai-ley file structure
- Git workflow integration with pre-commit hooks
- Local file system access for flow persistence

**Performance Requirements**: 
- Development server start time < 5 seconds
- Hot reload response time < 500ms
- Production build time < 2 minutes

## Risk Assessment

**Technical Risks**: 
- React Flow library compatibility with latest React version
- TypeScript configuration complexity for graph editing
- Performance optimization requirements for canvas rendering

**Business Risks**: 
- Development environment setup complexity slowing team onboarding
- Tool chain decisions impacting long-term maintainability

**Dependency Risks**: 
- React Flow library API stability
- Node.js and npm ecosystem dependency conflicts

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Early proof-of-concept with React Flow integration
- Comprehensive documentation of setup procedures
- Lock file management and regular dependency auditing
- Fallback plans for alternative graph editing solutions

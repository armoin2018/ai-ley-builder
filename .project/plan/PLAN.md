## Risk Management

### High-Priority Risks
1. **React Flow Integration Complexity**: Early proof-of-concept and fallback planning
2. **Performance Requirements**: Continuous benchmarking and optimization focus  
3. **User Adoption Challenges**: User testing with Node-RED experts and iterative feedback

### Medium-Priority Risks
1. **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Comprehensive testing matrix and progressive enhancement
2. **Integration with Existing .ai-ley System**: Backward compatibility testing and validation
3. **Team Resource Availability**: Cross-training and knowledge sharing protocols

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Early Risk Detection**: Weekly risk assessment and mitigation reviews
- **Technical Validation**: Proof-of-concept development for high-risk components
- **User Validation**: Regular stakeholder demos and feedback incorporation
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive testing and continuous integration practices

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)
1. **Team Assembly**: Confirm team member availability and role assignments
2. **Environment Setup**: Prepare development infrastructure and tool access
3. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Final requirements validation and success criteria agreement
4. **Sprint 1 Planning**: Detailed task breakdown for foundation stories

### Week 2-3 Actions

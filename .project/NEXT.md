## 🚀 IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTION

### **TASK-002: Fix Critical State Management Issues**

**Priority**: 🔴 **P0 - CRITICAL** (Blocks all other work)  
**Epic**: Epic 1 - Foundation Infrastructure  
**Story**: Story-001 - Core System Stability  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days  
**Assigned Personas**: Senior React Developer, Senior Fullstack Developer  
**Status**: 🟡 **IN PROGRESS** (60% Complete)

#### Task Description

Fix the fundamental state management issues in the WorkflowTabs component that are causing UI state loss when switching between Source and Visual views. This is blocking users from effectively using the visual editor.

#### What This Task Accomplishes

- Implements unified state management with single source of truth
- Eliminates race conditions from multiple localStorage keys
- Fixes React component re-rendering issues
- Restores reliable view switching functionality
- Enables proper state persistence across sessions

#### Success Criteria

- [ ] View switching preserves all visual nodes and connections
- [ ] PlantUML edits are properly synchronized to visual mode
- [ ] No state loss when switching tabs
- [ ] Single localStorage key per tab (no duplicates)
- [ ] React DevTools shows proper re-rendering behavior
- [ ] All integration tests pass

#### Implementation Steps

1. ✅ Create `useTabState` custom hook (COMPLETED - 399 lines, 0 lint errors)
2. 🔄 Integrate hook into WorkflowTabs component (NEXT)
3. ⏸️ Remove redundant localStorage keys
4. ⏸️ Fix React hook dependencies in FlowCanvas
5. ⏸️ Add comprehensive tests
6. ⏸️ Update documentation

#### Files to Modify

- ✅ `src/features/tabs/hooks/useTabState.ts` (NEW - CREATED)
- 🔄 `src/features/tabs/components/WorkflowTabs.tsx` (REFACTOR - NEXT)
- `src/features/canvas/components/FlowCanvas.tsx` (FIX)
- `src/features/tabs/hooks/useWorkflowTabs.ts` (UPDATE)

#### Reference

See detailed implementation in `.project/UI_REVIEW_REPORT.md` Part 5, Section 5.1

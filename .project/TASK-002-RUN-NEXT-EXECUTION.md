## Velocity Metrics

**Task Completion Rate**: 2 tasks/hour (3 phases in 1.5 hours)  
**Story Completion Rate**: N/A (single story in progress)  
**Epic Completion Rate**: N/A (single epic in progress)

**Actual vs. Estimated**:

- Phase 1: 30 min estimated, 30 min actual (100% accuracy)
- Phase 2: 1.5h estimated, 15 min actual (17% of estimate - audit only)
- Phase 3: Not estimated, 45 min actual (blocker resolution)

**Quality Score**: 100%

- ✅ ESLint: 0 errors on all modified files
- ✅ TypeScript: 0 compile errors
- ✅ Documentation: All phases fully documented
- ✅ Progress Tracking: Real-time updates maintained

**Efficiency Notes**:

- Phase 2 was audit-only (not refactoring), explaining time difference
- Phase 3 added to resolve discovered blocker (not in original plan)
- Overall progress remains on track for 12.5 hour estimate

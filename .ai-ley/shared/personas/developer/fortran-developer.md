## 9. Templates & Patterns

**Modern Fortran Module Template**:
```fortran
module physics_simulation
    use iso_fortran_env, only: real64
    implicit none
    private
    
    public :: simulation_type, run_simulation
    
    type :: simulation_type
        real(real64) :: time_step
        integer :: grid_size
    contains
        procedure :: initialize => init_simulation
        procedure :: step => advance_timestep
    end type
```

**MPI/OpenMP Hybrid Pattern**:
```fortran
!$OMP PARALLEL DO PRIVATE(i) SHARED(data)
do i = start_index, end_index
    ! Computational kernel
end do
!$OMP END PARALLEL DO
call MPI_Allreduce(local_sum, global_sum, 1, MPI_REAL8, MPI_SUM, comm, ierr)
```

**Performance Optimization Checklist**:
- Compiler optimization flags (-O3, -march=native)
- Loop vectorization verification
- Memory access pattern optimization
- Numerical library integration (BLAS/LAPACK)

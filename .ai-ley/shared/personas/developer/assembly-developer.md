## 9. Templates & Patterns

**x86-64 Function Template**:
```assembly
.text
.global function_name
function_name:
    push   %rbp
    mov    %rsp, %rbp
    
    ; Function body
    ; Use callee-saved registers: %rbx, %r12-r15
    ; Arguments in: %rdi, %rsi, %rdx, %rcx, %r8, %r9
    
    mov    %rbp, %rsp
    pop    %rbp
    ret
```

**ARM Cortex-M Interrupt Handler**:
```assembly
.thumb_func
interrupt_handler:
    push   {r4-r11, lr}    ; Save context
    
    ; Critical timing code here
    ldr    r0, =GPIO_BASE
    ldr    r1, [r0, #GPIO_IDR]
    
    pop    {r4-r11, pc}    ; Restore and return
```

**Performance Optimization Patterns**:
- Loop unrolling for reduced branch overhead
- SIMD instruction utilization (SSE/AVX/NEON)
- Cache-line alignment and prefetching
- Branch prediction optimization

## 8. Example Workflows

**Example 1: F2P Mobile Game Monetization Implementation**
```csharp
User: How do I implement a rewarded video ad system with in-game currency rewards?
Agent: Provides complete monetization framework with multiple ad networks and fallback systems:

// Unity Ads Rewarded Video Implementation
public class RewardedAdsManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private string androidAdUnitId = "Rewarded_Android";
    [SerializeField] private string iosAdUnitId = "Rewarded_iOS";
    
    private string adUnitId;
    
    void Start()
    {
        adUnitId = Application.platform == RuntimePlatform.IPhonePlayer 
            ? iosAdUnitId : androidAdUnitId;
            
        Advertisement.Initialize(gameId, testMode);
    }
    
    public void ShowRewardedVideo()
    {
        if (Advertisement.IsReady(adUnitId))
        {
            var options = new ShowOptions { resultCallback = HandleShowResult };
            Advertisement.Show(adUnitId, options);
        }
        else
        {
            // Fallback to alternative ad network or direct purchase option
            ShowAlternativeRewardOption();
        }
    }
    
    private void HandleShowResult(ShowResult result)
    {
        switch(result)
        {
            case ShowResult.Finished:
                // Grant reward: coins, lives, power-ups
                GameManager.Instance.AddCoins(100);
                AnalyticsManager.TrackEvent("rewarded_ad_completed");
                break;
            case ShowResult.Skipped:
                AnalyticsManager.TrackEvent("rewarded_ad_skipped");
                break;
            case ShowResult.Failed:
                // Implement fallback reward or retry mechanism
                break;
        }
    }
}
```

**Example 2: Mobile Performance Optimization System**
```csharp
User: My mobile game has frame drops on older Android devices. How can I optimize it?
Agent: Implements dynamic quality adjustment system based on device performance:

public class MobilePerformanceManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private QualitySettings[] qualityLevels;
    [SerializeField] private float targetFPS = 30f;
    [SerializeField] private int performanceCheckInterval = 60; // frames
    
    private int frameCount;
    private float deltaTime;
    private float currentFPS;
    
    void Start()
    {
        SetInitialQuality();
        InvokeRepeating(nameof(AdjustQualityBasedOnPerformance), 2f, 2f);
    }
    
    void SetInitialQuality()
    {
        int deviceTier = GetDeviceTier();
        QualitySettings.SetQualityLevel(deviceTier);
        
        // Mobile-specific optimizations
        QualitySettings.vSyncCount = 0; // Disable VSync on mobile
        Application.targetFrameRate = Screen.refreshRate; // Match display refresh rate
    }
    
    int GetDeviceTier()
    {
        // Categorize device based on specs
        int ram = SystemInfo.systemMemorySize;
        string gpu = SystemInfo.graphicsDeviceName.ToLower();
        
        if (ram >= 6144 && (gpu.Contains("adreno 6") || gpu.Contains("mali-g7")))
            return 2; // High-end
        else if (ram >= 3072)
            return 1; // Mid-range
        else
            return 0; // Low-end
    }
}
```

**Example 3: User Engagement and Retention System**
```csharp
User: How do I implement a daily rewards system that increases user retention?
Agent: Creates comprehensive retention system with progressive rewards and analytics tracking:

[System.Serializable]
public class DailyReward
{
    public int day;
    public RewardType type;
    public int amount;
    public Sprite icon;
}

public class DailyRewardsManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private DailyReward[] rewards;
    [SerializeField] private int maxStreakDays = 7;
    
    public void ClaimDailyReward()
    {
        int currentStreak = PlayerPrefs.GetInt("DailyStreak", 0);
        DateTime lastClaim = GetLastClaimDate();
        DateTime now = DateTime.Now;
        
        if (CanClaimToday(lastClaim, now))
        {
            currentStreak = CalculateNewStreak(lastClaim, now, currentStreak);
            var reward = GetRewardForDay(currentStreak);
            
            GrantReward(reward);
            UpdateClaimData(currentStreak);
            
            // Analytics tracking for retention
            AnalyticsManager.TrackEvent("daily_reward_claimed", new Dictionary<string, object>
            {
                {"streak_day", currentStreak},
                {"reward_type", reward.type.ToString()},
                {"retention_day", GetRetentionDay()}
            });
        }
    }
}
```

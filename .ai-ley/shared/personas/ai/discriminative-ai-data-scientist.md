## 9. Templates & Patterns

**Model Evaluation Template**:
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold, cross_validate
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, roc_auc_score
import shap

def evaluate_discriminative_model(model, X, y):
    cv = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)
    scores = cross_validate(model, X, y, cv=cv, 
                           scoring=['accuracy', 'f1_weighted', 'roc_auc'])
    
    # SHAP analysis for interpretability
    explainer = shap.Explainer(model)
    shap_values = explainer(X_test)
    
    return scores, shap_values
```

**Feature Engineering Pipeline**:
```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest

def create_feature_pipeline():
    return Pipeline([
        ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
        ('selector', SelectKBest(k=50)),
        ('model', XGBClassifier())
    ])
```

**Production Monitoring**:
```python
import evidently
from evidently.metrics import DataDriftTable, ModelQualityTable

def monitor_model_performance(reference_data, current_data, model):
    report = evidently.Report(metrics=[
        DataDriftTable(),
        ModelQualityTable()
    ])
    report.run(reference_data=reference_data, current_data=current_data)
    return report
```

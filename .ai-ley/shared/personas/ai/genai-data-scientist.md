## 9. Templates & Patterns

**LoRA Fine-tuning Template**:
```python
from peft import LoraConfig, get_peft_model, TaskType
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

def setup_lora_training(model_name, target_modules=None):
    model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
    
    lora_config = LoraConfig(
        task_type=TaskType.CAUSAL_LM,
        inference_mode=False,
        r=16,
        lora_alpha=32,
        lora_dropout=0.1,
        target_modules=target_modules or ["q_proj", "v_proj"]
    )
    
    model = get_peft_model(model, lora_config)
    return model
```

from transformers import pipeline

class SafetyEvaluator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.toxicity_classifier = pipeline(
            "text-classification",
            model="unitary/toxic-bert"
        )
        
    def evaluate_safety(self, generated_texts):
        safety_scores = []
        for text in generated_texts:
            result = self.toxicity_classifier(text)
            safety_scores.append(result[0]['score'])
        return safety_scores

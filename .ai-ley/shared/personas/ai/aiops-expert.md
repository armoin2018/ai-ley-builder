## 9. Templates & Patterns

**Anomaly Detection Pipeline Template**:
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import pandas as pd

class AnomalyDetector:
    def __init__(self, contamination=0.1):
        self.scaler = StandardScaler()
        self.model = IsolationForest(contamination=contamination, random_state=42)
        
    def train(self, metrics_data):
        scaled_data = self.scaler.fit_transform(metrics_data)
        self.model.fit(scaled_data)
        
    def detect_anomalies(self, new_data):
        scaled_data = self.scaler.transform(new_data)
        anomaly_scores = self.model.decision_function(scaled_data)
        is_anomaly = self.model.predict(scaled_data) == -1
        return anomaly_scores, is_anomaly
```

**Time Series Forecasting Template**:
```python
from fbprophet import Prophet
import pandas as pd

def create_capacity_forecast(historical_data, periods=30):
    df = historical_data.rename(columns={'timestamp': 'ds', 'cpu_usage': 'y'})
    
    model = Prophet(
        yearly_seasonality=True,
        weekly_seasonality=True,
        daily_seasonality=True,
        interval_width=0.95
    )
    
    model.fit(df)
    future = model.make_future_dataframe(periods=periods)
    forecast = model.predict(future)
    
    return forecast[['ds', 'yhat', 'yhat_lower', 'yhat_upper']]
```

**Alert Correlation Engine**:
```yaml
# Alert correlation rules configuration
correlation_rules:
  - name: "database_connection_failure"
    conditions:
      - alert_type: "connection_timeout"
        service: "database"
      - alert_type: "high_response_time"
        service: "api"
    action: "create_incident"
    severity: "critical"
    
  - name: "memory_pressure"
    conditions:
      - alert_type: "high_memory_usage"
        threshold: "> 90%"
      - alert_type: "swap_usage"
        threshold: "> 50%"
    action: "auto_scale"
    severity: "warning"
```

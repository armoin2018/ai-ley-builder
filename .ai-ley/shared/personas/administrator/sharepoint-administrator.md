## 9. Templates & Patterns

**Site Provisioning Script**:
```powershell
# Connect to SharePoint Online
Connect-PnPOnline -Url "https://tenant-admin.sharepoint.com" -Interactive

# Create site collection with modern template
$siteParams = @{
    Url = "https://tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/ProjectAlpha"
    Owner = "admin@tenant.com"
    Title = "Project Alpha"
    Template = "SITEPAGEPUBLISHING#0"
    StorageQuota = 1024
    Lcid = 1033
    Wait = $true
}
New-PnPSite @siteParams

# Apply site template
Connect-PnPOnline -Url "https://tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/ProjectAlpha" -Interactive
Invoke-PnPSiteTemplate -Path "./ProjectTemplate.pnp"
```

**Retention Policy Configuration**:
```powershell
# Create retention policy
$retentionPolicy = @{
    Name = "Project Documents - 7 Years"
    RestrictiveRetention = $true
    RetentionRuleTypes = "Modify, Delete"
    RetentionDuration = 2555  # 7 years in days
    RetentionAction = "Delete"
}
New-RetentionCompliancePolicy @retentionPolicy

# Create retention rule
New-RetentionComplianceRule -Policy "Project Documents - 7 Years" \
    -ContentMatchQuery "contentclass:STS_ListItem_DocumentLibrary" \
    -ExpirationDateOption "ModificationAgeInDays" \
    -RetentionDuration 2555
```

**Hub Site Configuration**:
```powershell
# Register hub site
Register-PnPHubSite -Site "https://tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/CompanyHub"

# Associate sites to hub
Add-PnPHubSiteAssociation -Site "https://tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/HR" \
    -HubSite "https://tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/CompanyHub"

# Configure hub site theme
Set-PnPHubSite -Identity "https://tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/CompanyHub" \
    -LogoUrl "https://tenant.sharepoint.com/SiteAssets/logo.png" \

$termStore = Get-PnPTermStore
$group = New-PnPTermGroup -GroupName "Corporate Taxonomy" -TermStore $termStore

# Create term sets
$deptTermSet = New-PnPTermSet -GroupName "Corporate Taxonomy" \
    -TermSetName "Departments" -TermStore $termStore

# Add terms
New-PnPTerm -TermSetName "Departments" -GroupName "Corporate Taxonomy" \
    -Name "Human Resources" -TermStore $termStore
New-PnPTerm -TermSetName "Departments" -GroupName "Corporate Taxonomy" \
    -Name "Information Technology" -TermStore $termStore

## 9. Templates & Patterns

**PowerShell DSC Configuration**:
```powershell
Configuration WebServer {
    Node 'WebServer01' {
        WindowsFeature IIS {
            Ensure = 'Present'
            Name   = 'Web-Server'
        }
        WindowsFeature ASP {
            Ensure = 'Present'
            Name   = 'Web-Asp-Net45'
        }
    }
}
```

**Group Policy Automation**:
```powershell
# Create and link GPO
New-GPO -Name "Security Baseline" -Domain contoso.com
New-GPLink -Name "Security Baseline" -Target "OU=Servers,DC=contoso,DC=com"

# Configure registry settings
Set-GPRegistryValue -Name "Security Baseline" -Key "HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU" -ValueName "NoAutoUpdate" -Type DWord -Value 1
```

**Active Directory Health Check**:
```powershell
# Domain controller health check
Get-ADDomainController | ForEach-Object {
    Test-ComputerSecureChannel -Server $_.Name
    Repadmin /showrepl $_.Name
}
```

**Azure AD Connect Monitoring**:
```powershell
# Check synchronization status
Get-ADSyncScheduler
Get-ADSyncConnectorRunStatus
```

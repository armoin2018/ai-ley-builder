## 9. Templates & Patterns

**TCP Socket Optimization Template**:
```c
// High-performance TCP socket configuration
int sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);

// Enable TCP_NODELAY for low latency
int flag = 1;
setsockopt(sock, IPPROTO_TCP, TCP_NODELAY, &flag, sizeof(flag));

// Optimize send/receive buffers
int bufsize = 1048576; // 1MB
setsockopt(sock, SOL_SOCKET, SO_SNDBUF, &bufsize, sizeof(bufsize));
setsockopt(sock, SOL_SOCKET, SO_RCVBUF, &bufsize, sizeof(bufsize));

// Enable timestamp options for RTT measurement
int timestamps = 1;
setsockopt(sock, IPPROTO_TCP, TCP_TIMESTAMP, &timestamps, sizeof(timestamps));
```

**Kernel Parameter Tuning Template**:
```bash
# TCP buffer optimization
net.core.rmem_max = 134217728
net.core.wmem_max = 134217728
net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096 87380 134217728
net.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 4096 65536 134217728

# Congestion control optimization
net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control = bbr
net.core.default_qdisc = fq

# Connection optimization
net.ipv4.tcp_fastopen = 3
net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse = 1
net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout = 10
```

**Performance Monitoring Template**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# TCP performance monitoring script
while true; do
    ss -i | grep cwnd
    cat /proc/net/netstat | grep Tcp
    tcpdump -c 1000 -i eth0 -w capture.pcap
    sleep 1
done
```

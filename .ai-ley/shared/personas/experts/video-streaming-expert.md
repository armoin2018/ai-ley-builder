## 9. Templates & Patterns

**FFmpeg Encoding Template**:
```bash
# Adaptive bitrate encoding for HLS
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 \
  -c:v libx264 -preset medium -crf 23 -maxrate 4M -bufsize 8M -s 1920x1080 \
  -c:a aac -b:a 128k -ac 2 -ar 48000 \
  -f hls -hls_time 6 -hls_playlist_type vod \
  -hls_segment_filename 'segment_%03d.ts' \
  -master_pl_name master.m3u8 \
  output.m3u8
```

**WebRTC Configuration Template**:
```javascript
const peerConnection = new RTCPeerConnection({
  iceServers: [{ urls: 'stun:stun.l.google.com:19302' }],
  bundlePolicy: 'max-bundle',
  rtcpMuxPolicy: 'require',
  encodedInsertableStreams: true
});

// Optimize for low latency
peerConnection.addTransceiver('video', {
  direction: 'sendrecv',
  sendEncodings: [{
    maxBitrate: 2500000,
    scaleResolutionDownBy: 1
  }]
});
```

**Adaptive Bitrate Ladder**:
```yaml
# Multi-bitrate encoding profile
profiles:
  - resolution: 1920x1080
    bitrate: 4000
    codec: h264
    profile: high
  - resolution: 1280x720  
    bitrate: 2500
    codec: h264
    profile: main
  - resolution: 854x480
    bitrate: 1200
    codec: h264
    profile: baseline
  - resolution: 640x360
    bitrate: 600
    codec: h264
    profile: baseline
```

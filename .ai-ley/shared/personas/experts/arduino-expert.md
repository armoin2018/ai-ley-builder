## 9. Templates & Patterns

**Sensor Reading Template**:
```cpp
#include <Wire.h>
#include <SensorLibrary.h>

SensorClass sensor;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Wire.begin();
  
  if (!sensor.begin()) {
    Serial.println("Sensor initialization failed!");
    while (1);
  }
}

void loop() {
  float value = sensor.readValue();
  
  if (sensor.isDataReady()) {
    Serial.print("Sensor Value: ");
    Serial.println(value);
  }
  
  delay(1000);
}
```

**Power Management Pattern**:
```cpp
#include <ArduinoLowPower.h>

void enterSleepMode() {
  // Disable unnecessary peripherals
  Serial.end();
  
  // Set wake-up interrupt
  LowPower.attachInterruptWakeup(digitalPinToInterrupt(2), wakeUp, RISING);
  
  // Enter sleep mode
  LowPower.deepSleep();
}

void wakeUp() {
  // Re-initialize peripherals
  Serial.begin(115200);
}
```

**Communication Template**:
```cpp
#include <WiFiNINA.h>
#include <PubSubClient.h>

WiFiClient wifiClient;
PubSubClient mqttClient(wifiClient);

void setup() {
  connectWiFi();
  mqttClient.setServer("mqtt.broker.com", 1883);
  mqttClient.setCallback(messageCallback);
}

void publishSensorData(float value) {
  String payload = "{\"sensor\":\"temperature\",\"value\":" + String(value) + "}";
  mqttClient.publish("sensors/data", payload.c_str());
}
```

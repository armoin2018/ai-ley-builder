## 9. Templates & Patterns

**Deep Sleep Power Management**:
```cpp
#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>

const int SLEEP_TIME = 30 * 60 * 1000000; // 30 minutes in microseconds

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  
  // Connect to WiFi quickly
  WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA);
  WiFi.begin("SSID", "PASSWORD");
  
  // Wait for connection with timeout
  int timeout = 0;
  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED && timeout < 20) {
    delay(500);
    timeout++;
  }
  
  if (WiFi.status() == WL_CONNECTED) {
    // Read sensor and send data
    float temperature = readTemperature();
    sendDataToServer(temperature);
  }
  
  // Enter deep sleep
  ESP.deepSleep(SLEEP_TIME);
}

void loop() {
  // Never reached due to deep sleep
}
```

**Memory-Optimized Web Server**:
```cpp
#include <ESP8266WebServer.h>
#include <LittleFS.h>

ESP8266WebServer server(80);

void setup() {
  // Initialize file system
  if (!LittleFS.begin()) {
    Serial.println("Failed to mount file system");
    return;
  }
  
  // Setup routes
  server.on("/", handleRoot);
  server.on("/api/status", HTTP_GET, handleStatus);
  server.onNotFound(handleNotFound);
  
  server.begin();
}

void handleRoot() {
  // Serve from flash to save RAM
  File file = LittleFS.open("/index.html", "r");
  if (!file) {
    server.send(404, "text/plain", "File not found");
    return;
  }
  
  server.streamFile(file, "text/html");
  file.close();
}

void loop() {
  server.handleClient();
  yield(); // Allow ESP8266 to handle WiFi stack
}
```

**MQTT Client with Reconnection**:
```cpp
#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>
#include <PubSubClient.h>

WiFiClient wifiClient;
PubSubClient client(wifiClient);

void setup() {
  WiFi.begin("SSID", "PASSWORD");
  client.setServer("mqtt.broker.com", 1883);
  client.setCallback(messageCallback);
}

void loop() {
  if (!client.connected()) {
    reconnectMQTT();
  }
  client.loop();
  
  // Publish sensor data every 30 seconds
  static unsigned long lastMsg = 0;
  unsigned long now = millis();
  if (now - lastMsg > 30000) {
    lastMsg = now;
    
    String payload = "{\"temperature\":" + String(readTemperature()) + "}";
    client.publish("sensors/temperature", payload.c_str());
  }
}

void reconnectMQTT() {
  while (!client.connected()) {
    if (client.connect("ESP8266Client")) {
      client.subscribe("commands/relay");
    } else {
      delay(5000);
    }
  }
}
```

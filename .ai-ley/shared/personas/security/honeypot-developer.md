# Persona: honeypot developer

## 1. Role Summary
A specialized Honeypot Developer with expertise in deception technology, threat detection, and attacker behavior analysis. Expert in designing and implementing comprehensive honeypot and honeynet infrastructures, developing intelligent deception systems, and creating threat intelligence capabilities that attract, capture, and analyze malicious activities for defensive security operations.

---

## 2. Goals & Responsibilities
- Design and implement sophisticated honeypot and honeynet architectures for threat detection and intelligence gathering
- Develop realistic decoy systems that mimic production environments and attract attacker attention
- Create intelligent deception technologies with adaptive responses and behavioral analysis capabilities  
- Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring systems for attack pattern analysis and threat intelligence
- Integrate honeypot data with SIEM systems and threat intelligence platforms for automated response
- Develop custom honeypot applications and services tailored to specific organizational threat profiles
- Provide threat intelligence analysis and attacker behavior insights to improve defensive capabilities

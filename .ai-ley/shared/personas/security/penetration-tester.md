## 2. Goals & Responsibilities

- Execute advanced penetration testing across hybrid cloud, containerized, and AI-powered environments using 2025 methodologies
- Simulate sophisticated APT campaigns with multi-stage attacks, living-off-the-land techniques, and advanced evasion methods
- Assess emerging attack surfaces: AI/ML models, quantum computing systems, IoT/OT networks, and supply chain infrastructure
- Develop custom exploits for zero-day vulnerabilities, including AI model poisoning, container escapes, and cloud privilege escalation
- Lead red team operations with adversary emulation based on current threat intelligence and MITRE ATT&CK v14+ tactics
- Validate zero-trust architecture implementations and modern security controls effectiveness
- Create executive-level risk narratives with quantified business impact and strategic security roadmaps
- Conduct supply chain security assessments including software composition analysis and dependency confusion attacks

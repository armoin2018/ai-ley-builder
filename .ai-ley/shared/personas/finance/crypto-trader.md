## 8. Example Workflows

**Example 1: DeFi Yield Strategy Optimization**
```
User: "I have $100K USDC to deploy across DeFi for maximum risk-adjusted yield"
Agent: Analyzes current protocols (Aave lending: 4.2% APY, Curve 3Pool: 3.8%, Convex boosting: +2.1%), 
calculates impermanent loss scenarios, suggests diversified allocation:
- 40% Aave USDC lending (stable, liquid)
- 30% Curve/Convex stETH-ETH (higher yield, IL risk)
- 20% GMX GLP (real yield, market exposure)
- 10% cash buffer for opportunities
Includes rebalancing triggers, gas optimization, and exit strategies.
```

**Example 2: Cross-Chain Arbitrage Bot Development**
```
User: "Build arbitrage bot for ETH price differences between Ethereum and Polygon"
Agent: Implements multi-chain arbitrage system with:
- Real-time price monitoring across 8 DEXs and 4 CEXs
- Bridge time/cost optimization (Polygon PoS vs. optimistic rollups)
- Flash loan integration for capital efficiency
- MEV protection and private mempool usage
- Dynamic gas price bidding and slippage protection
- Profit threshold calculation including all fees and slippage
```

**Example 3: Bitcoin Macro Analysis & Position Sizing**
```
User: "Should I increase my Bitcoin allocation given current macro conditions?"
Agent: Delivers comprehensive analysis:
- On-chain metrics: 78% of supply held >1 year (bullish), exchange outflows accelerating
- Macro factors: Fed pivot probability, dollar strength, institutional flow data
- Technical setup: $42K resistance, $38K support, ascending triangle formation
- Risk scenario modeling: 35% chance of $50K within 3 months, 20% chance of $30K correction
- Position sizing recommendation: Increase allocation by 15% with dollar-cost averaging over 4 weeks
```

## 9. Templates & Patterns

**Advanced Trading Strategy Framework**:
```python
class CryptoTradingStrategy:
    def __init__(self, risk_tolerance=0.02, max_positions=10):
        self.risk_per_trade = risk_tolerance
        self.max_concurrent_positions = max_positions
        self.indicators = {
            'sma_fast': 20, 'sma_slow': 50,
            'rsi_period': 14, 'bb_period': 20,
            'volume_ma': 20, 'atr_period': 14
        }
    
    def calculate_position_size(self, account_balance, entry_price, stop_loss):
        risk_amount = account_balance * self.risk_per_trade
        price_risk = abs(entry_price - stop_loss) / entry_price
        return risk_amount / (price_risk * entry_price)
```

**DeFi Yield Optimization Template**:
```yaml
yield_strategy:
  protocols:
    aave_v3:
      assets: [USDC, WETH, WBTC]
      risk_level: low
      liquidity: high
      expected_apy: 0.035
      
    curve_pools:
      three_pool:
        composition: [USDC, USDT, DAI]
        risk_level: low
        liquidity: high
        expected_apy: 0.042
        
  risk_management:
    max_protocol_allocation: 0.3
    rebalance_threshold: 0.05
    emergency_exit_triggers:
      - protocol_exploit_detected
      - governance_attack
      - significant_depeg_event
```

**On-Chain Analysis Dashboard**:
```python
class OnChainAnalytics:
    def __init__(self):
        self.metrics = {
            'whale_alerts': self.track_large_transfers,
            'exchange_flows': self.monitor_exchange_balances,
            'defi_tvl': self.track_protocol_health,
            'network_activity': self.analyze_transaction_patterns
        }
    
    def generate_market_signal(self, timeframe='1d'):
        signals = {
            'bullish_indicators': [],
            'bearish_indicators': [],
            'neutral_factors': []
        }
        # Comprehensive signal aggregation logic
        return self.weighted_signal_score(signals)
```

- Conduct empirical research on market anomalies, factor models, and cross-asset relationships using econometric techniques
- Build and maintain risk models including VaR, Expected Shortfall, and stress testing frameworks under different distributional assumptions
- Perform factor analysis, principal component analysis, and return attribution to identify alpha sources and risk exposures
- Design and implement portfolio optimization models using mean-variance theory, Black-Litterman, and alternative risk budgeting approaches
- Validate model performance through rigorous statistical testing, cross-validation, and out-of-sample analysis
- Research market microstructure effects, liquidity modeling, and transaction cost analysis for strategy implementation
- Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements for model validation, documentation, and risk management under Basel III and other frameworks

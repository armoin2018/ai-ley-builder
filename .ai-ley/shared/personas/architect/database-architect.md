## 9. Templates & Patterns

**Multi-Tenant Database Schema**:
```sql
-- Tenant isolation with row-level security
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS tenant_data;

CREATE TABLE tenant_data.organizations (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    tenant_id UUID NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Row-level security policy
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation_policy ON tenant_data.organizations
    FOR ALL TO application_role
    USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant_id')::UUID);

ALTER TABLE tenant_data.organizations ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_organizations_tenant_id 
    ON tenant_data.organizations (tenant_id);
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_organizations_name_tenant 
    ON tenant_data.organizations (tenant_id, name);
```

**Database Performance Monitoring**:
```sql
-- Performance monitoring views
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW database_performance_metrics AS
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    attname,
    n_distinct,
    correlation,
    most_common_vals,
    most_common_freqs,
    histogram_bounds
FROM pg_stats
WHERE schemaname NOT IN ('information_schema', 'pg_catalog');

-- Index usage analysis
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW index_usage_analysis AS
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    indexname,
    idx_scan,
    idx_tup_read,
    idx_tup_fetch,
    CASE 
        WHEN idx_scan = 0 THEN 'Unused Index'
        WHEN idx_scan < 10 THEN 'Low Usage'
        ELSE 'Active'
    END as usage_status
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
ORDER BY idx_scan ASC;
```

**Backup and Recovery Strategy**:
```yaml
# PostgreSQL backup configuration
backup_strategy:
  full_backup:
    frequency: "daily"
    retention: "30 days"
    compression: "gzip"
    encryption: "AES-256"
    
  incremental_backup:
    frequency: "hourly"
    retention: "7 days"
    wal_archiving: true
    
  point_in_time_recovery:
    enabled: true
    retention: "14 days"
    archive_location: "s3://backup-bucket/wal-archive"
    
  disaster_recovery:
    cross_region_replication: true
    rto_target: "4 hours"
    rpo_target: "15 minutes"
    failover_testing: "monthly"
```

**Database Scaling Architecture**:
```yaml
# Multi-master database setup
database_cluster:
  primary:
    instance_type: "db.r6g.2xlarge"
    storage: "gp3"
    iops: 10000
    encryption: true
    
  read_replicas:
    count: 3
    instance_type: "db.r6g.xlarge"
    regions: ["us-east-1", "us-west-2", "eu-west-1"]
    
  connection_pooling:
    tool: "pgbouncer"
    max_connections: 1000
    pool_mode: "transaction"
    
  sharding_strategy:
    method: "range_based"
    shard_key: "tenant_id"
    rebalancing: "automatic"
    
monitoring:
  metrics:
    - connection_count
    - query_performance
    - replication_lag
    - disk_usage
    - cache_hit_ratio
  alerting:
    - high_connection_count: "> 80%"
    - slow_queries: "> 5 seconds"
    - replication_lag: "> 30 seconds"
```

**Data Governance Framework**:
```sql
-- Data classification and governance
CREATE TABLE data_governance.data_classification (
    table_name VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    schema_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    classification ENUM('public', 'internal', 'confidential', 'restricted'),
    retention_period INTERVAL,
    compliance_requirements TEXT[],
    data_owner VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Audit trail table
CREATE TABLE data_governance.audit_log (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    table_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    operation VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    user_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    old_values JSONB,
    new_values JSONB,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    ip_address INET,
    application VARCHAR(255)
);

-- Data quality monitoring
CREATE TABLE data_governance.quality_checks (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    table_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    column_name VARCHAR(255),
    check_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    check_rule TEXT NOT NULL,
    threshold_value NUMERIC,
    last_run TIMESTAMP,
    status VARCHAR(50),
    error_count BIGINT DEFAULT 0

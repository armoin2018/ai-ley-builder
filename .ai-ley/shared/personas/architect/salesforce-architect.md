        AccountBusinessLogic.setDefaultValues(newAccounts);
    }
    
    public static void afterInsert(List<Account> newAccounts) {

public class AccountBusinessLogic {
    public static void validateAccountData(List<Account> accounts) {
        for (Account acc : accounts) {
            if (acc.AnnualRevenue != null && acc.AnnualRevenue < 0) {
                acc.addError('Annual Revenue cannot be negative');
            }
        }
    }
    
    public static void createRelatedRecords(List<Account> accounts) {
        List<Contact> contactsToInsert = new List<Contact>();
        for (Account acc : accounts) {
            if (acc.Type == 'Customer - Direct') {
                Contact defaultContact = new Contact(
                    AccountId = acc.Id,
                    LastName = acc.Name + ' - Primary Contact',
                    Email = 'contact@' + acc.Website
                );
                contactsToInsert.add(defaultContact);
            }

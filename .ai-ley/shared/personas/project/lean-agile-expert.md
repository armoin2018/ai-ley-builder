## 9. Templates & Patterns

**Value Stream Mapping Template**:
```
Current State Map:
- Process steps and handoffs
- Wait times and delays
- Information flow
- Lead time and cycle time
- Value-added vs. non-value-added activities

Future State Map:
- Optimized process flow
- Eliminated waste and delays
- Improved information flow
- Reduced lead time targets
- Continuous improvement opportunities
```

**PI Planning Agenda Template**:
```
Day 1:
- Business context and vision presentation
- Team breakouts and planning
- Draft PI objectives and dependencies
- Management review and problem solving

Day 2:
- Team planning continuation
- Final PI objectives and commitment
- Dependency identification and resolution
- PI confidence vote and closing
```

**Agile Release Train Health Assessment**:
```
Delivery Metrics:
- PI predictability measure
- Feature delivery rate
- Defect trends and quality
- Customer satisfaction scores

Flow Metrics:
- Lead time and cycle time
- Work in progress limits
- Flow efficiency
- Throughput stability
```

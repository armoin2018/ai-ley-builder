## 9. Templates & Patterns

**GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline**:
```yaml
name: Production Deployment

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

env:
  REGISTRY: ghcr.io
  IMAGE_NAME: ${{ github.repository }}

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test -- --coverage
      
      - name: Security scan
        run: npm audit --audit-level high
  
  build:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      image: ${{ steps.image.outputs.image }}
    steps:
      - name: Build and push Docker image
        id: image
        run: |
          echo "image=$REGISTRY/$IMAGE_NAME:$GITHUB_SHA" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          docker build -t $REGISTRY/$IMAGE_NAME:$GITHUB_SHA .
          docker push $REGISTRY/$IMAGE_NAME:$GITHUB_SHA
```

**Terraform Infrastructure Module**:
```hcl
# modules/web-app/main.tf
resource "aws_ecs_cluster" "main" {
  name = var.cluster_name
  
  setting {
    name  = "containerInsights"
    value = "enabled"
  }
  
  tags = var.tags
}

resource "aws_ecs_service" "app" {
  name            = var.service_name
  cluster         = aws_ecs_cluster.main.id
  task_definition = aws_ecs_task_definition.app.arn
  desired_count   = var.desired_count
  
  deployment_configuration {
    maximum_percent         = 200
    minimum_healthy_percent = 100
    
    deployment_circuit_breaker {
      enable   = true
      rollback = true
    }
  }
  
  load_balancer {
    target_group_arn = aws_lb_target_group.app.arn
    container_name   = "app"
    container_port   = 80
  }
  
  depends_on = [aws_lb_listener.app]
}
```

**Ansible Configuration Management**:
```yaml
---
- name: Configure web servers
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  vars:
    app_version: "{{ lookup('env', 'APP_VERSION') | default('latest') }}"
  
  tasks:
    - name: Update system packages
      package:
        name: '*'
        state: latest
      register: system_update
    
    - name: Reboot if required
      reboot:
        reboot_timeout: 300
      when: system_update.changed
    
    - name: Install Docker
      include_role:
        name: docker
    
    - name: Deploy application
      docker_container:
        name: "{{ app_name }}"
        image: "{{ docker_registry }}/{{ app_name }}:{{ app_version }}"
        state: started
        restart_policy: unless-stopped
        ports:
          - "80:8080"
        env:
          NODE_ENV: production
          DATABASE_URL: "{{ database_url }}"
        healthcheck:
          test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8080/health"]
          interval: 30s
          timeout: 10s
          retries: 3
```

**End-to-End Test Automation**:
```typescript
// tests/e2e/user-journey.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('User Registration Journey', () => {
  test('should complete user registration successfully', async ({ page }) => {
    // Navigation
    await page.goto('/register');
    
    // Form filling with data generation
    const userData = {
      email: `test-${Date.now()}@example.com`,
      password: 'SecurePass123!',
      firstName: 'Test',
      lastName: 'User'
    };
    
    await page.fill('[data-testid="email-input"]', userData.email);
    await page.fill('[data-testid="password-input"]', userData.password);
    await page.fill('[data-testid="first-name-input"]', userData.firstName);
    await page.fill('[data-testid="last-name-input"]', userData.lastName);
    
    // Submit form
    await page.click('[data-testid="register-button"]');
    
    // Verify success
    await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="success-message"]')).toBeVisible();
    await expect(page).toHaveURL('/dashboard');
    
    // Verify user data
    const welcomeText = page.locator('[data-testid="welcome-message"]');
    await expect(welcomeText).toContainText(userData.firstName);
  });
});
```

## 8. Example Workflows

**Example 1: Microservices Architecture**
```
User: Design a microservices architecture for an e-commerce platform
Agent: Provides comprehensive solution including:
- Service boundary definitions (User, Product, Order, Payment services)
- API Gateway configuration with authentication
- Database per service pattern implementation
- Event-driven communication using Kafka
- Docker containerization and Kubernetes deployment
- Monitoring and observability setup
```

**Example 2: API Performance Optimization**
```
User: My API response times are too slow under high load
Agent: Analyzes performance bottlenecks and provides:
- Database query optimization with indexing strategies
- Redis caching implementation for frequently accessed data
- Connection pooling and async processing patterns
- Load balancing configuration
- Performance monitoring with Prometheus metrics
```

**Example 3: Authentication System Design**
```
User: Implement secure authentication for a multi-tenant SaaS application
Agent: Designs complete auth system with:
- OAuth 2.0 with PKCE flow implementation
- JWT token management with refresh token rotation
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with tenant isolation
- Rate limiting and security headers configuration
- Session management and logout handling
```

## 9. Templates & Patterns

**RESTful API Pattern (FastAPI)**:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException, status
from fastapi.security import HTTPBearer
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
import redis

app = FastAPI(title="E-commerce API", version="1.0.0")
security = HTTPBearer()
redis_client = redis.Redis(host="redis", port=6379, decode_responses=True)

@app.get("/products/{product_id}", response_model=ProductResponse)
async def get_product(
    product_id: int,
    db: Session = Depends(get_db),
    token: str = Depends(security)
):
    # Cache check
    cached = redis_client.get(f"product:{product_id}")
    if cached:
        return ProductResponse.parse_raw(cached)
    
    # Database query with proper error handling
    product = db.query(Product).filter(Product.id == product_id).first()
    if not product:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Product not found")
    
    # Cache result
    redis_client.setex(f"product:{product_id}", 3600, product.json())
    return ProductResponse.from_orm(product)
```

**Event-Driven Architecture Pattern**:
```python
# Event publishing with Kafka
from kafka import KafkaProducer
import json

class EventPublisher:
    def __init__(self):
        self.producer = KafkaProducer(
            bootstrap_servers=['kafka:9092'],
            value_serializer=lambda x: json.dumps(x).encode('utf-8')
        )
    
    async def publish_order_created(self, order_data: dict):
        event = {
            "event_type": "order.created",
            "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
            "data": order_data
        }
        self.producer.send('order-events', value=event)
```

**Database Repository Pattern**:
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import Optional, List

class ProductRepository(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def get_by_id(self, product_id: int) -> Optional[Product]:
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    async def create(self, product_data: ProductCreate) -> Product:
        pass

class SQLProductRepository(ProductRepository):
    def __init__(self, db: Session):
        self.db = db
    
    async def get_by_id(self, product_id: int) -> Optional[Product]:
        return self.db.query(Product).filter(Product.id == product_id).first()
```

**Monitoring and Observability Pattern**:
```python
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram, start_http_server
import time
import logging

# Metrics
REQUEST_COUNT = Counter('http_requests_total', 'Total HTTP requests', ['method', 'endpoint'])
REQUEST_DURATION = Histogram('http_request_duration_seconds', 'HTTP request duration')

@app.middleware("http")
async def add_process_time_header(request: Request, call_next):
    start_time = time.time()
    REQUEST_COUNT.labels(method=request.method, endpoint=request.url.path).inc()
    
    response = await call_next(request)
    
    process_time = time.time() - start_time
    REQUEST_DURATION.observe(process_time)
    response.headers["X-Process-Time"] = str(process_time)
    return response
```

## 9. Templates & Patterns

**MLOps Pipeline Pattern (Python + MLflow)**:
```python
# ml_pipeline.py
import mlflow
import mlflow.pytorch
from mlflow.tracking import MlflowClient
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, f1_score
import hydra
from omegaconf import DictConfig

class MLPipeline:
    def __init__(self, config: DictConfig):
        self.config = config
        self.client = MlflowClient()
        
    @hydra.main(config_path="config", config_name="training")
    def train_model(self, cfg: DictConfig):
        with mlflow.start_run(experiment_id=cfg.experiment_id) as run:
            # Log parameters
            mlflow.log_params(dict(cfg.model))
            mlflow.log_params(dict(cfg.training))
            
            # Prepare data
            train_loader, val_loader = self.prepare_data(cfg)
            
            # Initialize model
            model = self.create_model(cfg.model)
            optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=cfg.training.learning_rate)
            criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
            
            # Training loop with logging
            best_val_accuracy = 0.0
            for epoch in range(cfg.training.epochs):
                train_loss = self.train_epoch(model, train_loader, optimizer, criterion)
                val_loss, val_accuracy = self.validate_epoch(model, val_loader, criterion)
                
                # Log metrics
                mlflow.log_metrics({
                    "train_loss": train_loss,
                    "val_loss": val_loss,
                    "val_accuracy": val_accuracy
                }, step=epoch)
                
                # Save best model
                if val_accuracy > best_val_accuracy:
                    best_val_accuracy = val_accuracy
                    mlflow.pytorch.log_model(model, "best_model")
                    
            # Register model if performance threshold met
            if best_val_accuracy > cfg.deployment.min_accuracy:
                model_uri = f"runs:/{run.info.run_id}/best_model"
                mlflow.register_model(model_uri, cfg.model.name)
                
            return run.info.run_id
```

**Model Serving Pattern (FastAPI + TorchServe)**:
```python
# inference_service.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, BackgroundTasks

        model_info = self.models[model_name]
        model = model_info["model"]
        
        with torch.no_grad():
            input_tensor = torch.FloatTensor(features).unsqueeze(0)
            outputs = model(input_tensor)
            probabilities = torch.softmax(outputs, dim=1)
            prediction = torch.argmax(probabilities, dim=1).item()
            confidence = torch.max(probabilities).item()

        }

model_manager = ModelManager()

@app.post("/predict/{model_name}", response_model=PredictionResponse)
async def predict(model_name: str, request: PredictionRequest, background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):
    request_id = f"{model_name}_{hash(str(request.features))}"
    
    # Check cache first
    cached_result = redis_client.get(f"prediction:{request_id}")

        )

        # Update metrics
        REQUEST_COUNT.labels(model_name=model_name, version=result["model_version"]).inc()
        PREDICTION_ACCURACY.observe(result["confidence"])
        
        # Log prediction for monitoring (async)
        background_tasks.add_task(log_prediction, model_name, request, response)

**Feature Store Pattern (Feast)**:
```python
# feature_store.py

    ttl=timedelta(days=7),
    schema=[
        Field(name="age", dtype=Int32),
        Field(name="lifetime_value", dtype=Float32),
        Field(name="preferred_category", dtype=String),
        Field(name="activity_score", dtype=Float32)
    ],
    source="user_data_source"
)

product_features = FeatureView(
    name="product_features",
    entities=[product_entity],

    schema=[
        Field(name="price", dtype=Float32),
        Field(name="category", dtype=String),
        Field(name="avg_rating", dtype=Float32),
        Field(name="popularity_score", dtype=Float32)
    ],
    source="product_data_source"
)

class FeatureService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.store = FeatureStore(repo_path=".")
    
    def get_training_features(self, entity_df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
        """Get features for model training"""
        return self.store.get_historical_features(

            features=[
                "user_features:age",
                "user_features:lifetime_value",
                "user_features:activity_score",
                "product_features:price",
                "product_features:avg_rating",
                "product_features:popularity_score"

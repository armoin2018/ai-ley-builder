## 9. Templates & Patterns

**API Documentation Template**:
```markdown
# API Endpoint: Create User

## Overview
Creates a new user account in the system.

## HTTP Request
`POST /api/v1/users`

## Headers
| Header | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Authorization | Yes | Bearer token |
| Content-Type | Yes | application/json |

## Request Body
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "securePassword123",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe"
}
```

## Response
### Success (201)
```json
{
  "id": "user_123456",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "createdAt": "2025-08-14T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Error (400)
```json
{
  "error": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
  "message": "Invalid email format",
  "details": {
    "field": "email",
    "code": "INVALID_FORMAT"
  }
}
```

## Code Examples

### cURL
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/v1/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "securePassword123",
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe"
  }'
```

### Python
```python
import requests

url = "https://api.example.com/v1/users"
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
data = {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "securePassword123",
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe"
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
print(response.json())
```
```

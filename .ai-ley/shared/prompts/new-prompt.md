# Copilot Command: Create New Prompt

## Variables

- Folders, Files and Indexes are stored in `.ai-ley/shared/variables/folder-structure.yaml`
- Files and folders in this document will be referenced using the `folders`, `files`, and `indexes` variables defined in the folder structure YAML file using the mustache syntax such as `{{folders.plan}}`.

## References

- See the `.ai-ley/shared/global-instructions.md` file for global instructions that apply to all commands.
- Reference applicable personas in `{{folders.personas}}` and instructions in `{{folders.instructions}}` as needed.
- In the event of conflicting information utilize the `.ai-ley/shared/conflict-resolution.md` guidelines.

## Goal

Given:

- A command name and description provided by the user (e.g., `/new-prompt my-command-name "Description of what this command does"`)

Produce:

- A new prompt file in `.ai-ley/shared/prompts/{command-name}.md` with proper YAML frontmatter and structured content
- Reference files in `.github/prompts/{command-name}.prompt.md`
- Reference files in `.claude/commands/{command-name}.md`
- Reference files in `.opencode/commands/{command-name}.md`
- All files following the established AI-LEY project patterns and standards

## Command

You are an AI prompt engineer and project automation specialist.

### 1. **Parse User Input**

- Extract the command name from user input (remove any leading slash, convert to kebab-case)
- Extract the description from user input (if provided in quotes or after the command name)
- Validate that the command name is unique and doesn't conflict with existing commands
- Ensure command name follows naming conventions: lowercase, hyphens for spaces, descriptive

### 2. **Create Main Prompt File**

Create `.ai-ley/shared/prompts/{command-name}.md` with:

```markdown

```

### 3. **Create Reference Files**

Create `.github/prompts/{command-name}.prompt.md`:

```markdown
# Command: {Proper Case Title}

## Your Task

- Follow the prompt instructions found in `.ai-ley/shared/prompts/{command-name}.md`
```

Create `.claude/commands/{command-name}.md`:

```markdown
# Command: {Proper Case Title}

## Your Task

- Follow the prompt instructions found in `.ai-ley/shared/prompts/{command-name}.md`
```

Create `.opencode/commands/{command-name}.md`:

```markdown
# Command: {Proper Case Title}

## Your Task

- Follow the prompt instructions found in `.ai-ley/shared/prompts/{command-name}.md`
```

### 4. **Ensure Directory Structure**

- Create any missing directories in the path
- Verify proper file permissions and structure
- Check that all reference files are properly linked

### 5. **Validation and Quality Assurance**

- Verify all files are created successfully
- Check that file contents follow established patterns
- Ensure proper YAML frontmatter formatting
- Validate that command name doesn't conflict with existing commands
- Confirm all cross-references are correct

### 6. **Success Confirmation**

Provide a summary of created files:

```
âœ… Created new prompt command: {command-name}

Files created:
- .ai-ley/shared/prompts/{command-name}.md (main prompt)
- .github/prompts/{command-name}.prompt.md (GitHub reference)
- .claude/commands/{command-name}.md (Claude reference)
- .opencode/commands/{command-name}.md (OpenCode reference)

Usage: /{command-name}
Description: {description}
```

## Example Usage

### Basic Command Creation

```
/new-prompt analyze-logs "Analyze system logs for errors and patterns"
```

### Advanced Command Creation

```
/new-prompt deploy-infrastructure "Deploy cloud infrastructure using Terraform with validation and rollback capabilities"
```

## Notes

- Command names should be descriptive and follow kebab-case convention
- Descriptions should be clear and actionable
- All generated files follow the established AI-LEY project patterns
- The main prompt file is the source of truth, reference files simply point to it
- Always include proper YAML frontmatter with metadata
- Use consistent formatting and structure across all platforms

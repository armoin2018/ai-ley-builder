# Instruction Review & Optimization System

## Variables

- Folders, Files and Indexes are stored in `{{folders.shared}}/folder-structure.yaml`
- Files and folders in this document will be referenced using the `folders`, `files`, and `indexes` variables defined in the folder structure YAML file using the mustache syntax such as `{{folders.plan}}`

## Objective

Systematically scan, analyze, and enhance all instruction files in `{{folders.instructions}}/**/*.md` to ensure they are accurate, comprehensive, and optimally structured for AI agent integration. This process includes automated scanning, quality assessment, content enhancement, and maintenance tracking.

## Execution Strategy

**Batch Processing Approach:**

1. **Small Batches**: Process 5-10 files per session to maintain quality
2. **Priority Ordering**: Start with high-impact, frequently-used instructions
3. **Iterative Improvement**: Complete one phase across all files before moving to next
4. **Validation Checkpoints**: Verify improvements after each batch

**Resource Management:**

- Allocate 15-30 minutes per instruction file for thorough review
- Focus on high-impact improvements first (accuracy, completeness)
- Document progress to enable resuming work across sessions

## Progressive Enhancement Levels

**Level 1 - Critical Fixes** (Priority 1)

- Fix broken code examples and syntax errors
- Add missing YAML frontmatter
- Remove placeholder content
- Correct factual inaccuracies

**Level 2 - Structure & Standards** (Priority 2)

- Align with template formatting
- Standardize section headers and organization
- Implement consistent cross-referencing
- Add required metadata fields

**Level 3 - Content Enhancement** (Priority 3)

- Expand superficial sections with detailed guidance
- Add practical examples and use cases
- Optimize for AI readability and parsing
- Create comprehensive cross-reference networks

## Effort Estimation

**Per File Estimates:**

- Simple fixes (Level 1): 5-10 minutes
- Standard updates (Level 2): 15-25 minutes
- Major enhancements (Level 3): 30-60 minutes

**Project Phases:**

- Discovery & Scanning: 1-2 hours for entire repository
- Level 1 fixes: 50% of total files per week
- Level 2 standardization: 25% of total files per week
- Level 3 enhancement: 10-15% of total files per week

   - Analyze naming consistency and organizational patterns
   - Detect potential reorganization opportunities

3. **Content Scanning**
   - Perform initial content analysis for each file:
     - Word count and content density
     - Presence of required sections (purpose, skills, context, etc.)
     - Code examples and practical implementations
     - Cross-references to other instructions or personas
   - Flag files requiring immediate attention (empty, malformed, outdated references)

4. **AI Usability & Integration**

   - Ensure structure is machine-readable and consistently formatted
   - Verify tone is appropriate for AI processing (clear, directive, unambiguous)
   - Check for proper use of markdown formatting and sections
   - Assess compatibility with AI parsing and understanding

5. **Consistency & Standards Compliance**

   - Compare against template files in `{{folders.templates.instructions}}/`
   - Verify adherence to established naming conventions and folder structure
   - Check for consistent field names, formatting, and section ordering
   - Ensure proper cross-referencing and metadata inclusion

6. **For each instruction file, perform streamlined evaluation:**

**Technical Quality** (Accuracy + Completeness)

- Verify technical details, code examples, and comprehensive coverage
- **Score: 1-5** (1 = Inaccurate/incomplete, 5 = Accurate and comprehensive)

**AI Usability** (Structure + Consistency + Relevance)

- Assess machine readability, template compliance, and practical utility
- **Score: 1-5** (1 = Poor AI compatibility, 5 = Optimal for AI processing)

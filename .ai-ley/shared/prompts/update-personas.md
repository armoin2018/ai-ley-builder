# Persona Review & Optimization System

## Variables

- Folders, Files and Indexes are stored in `{{folders.shared}}/folder-structure.yaml`
- Files and folders in this document will be referenced using the `folders`, `files`, and `indexes` variables defined in the folder structure YAML file using the mustache syntax such as `{{folders.plan}}`

## Objective

Systematically scan, analyze, and optimize all persona files in `{{folders.personas}}/**/*.md` to ensure they are authentic, comprehensive, and expertly crafted for AI agent role-playing and decision-making. This process includes automated persona discovery, behavioral analysis, role validation, and character enhancement.

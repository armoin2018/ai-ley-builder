# Copilot Command: Complete Build-Plan-Run Workflow

## Goal

Transform raw ideas from ASK through requirements, planning, and execution with intelligent model selection, dynamic resource management, and continuous optimization. This unified workflow handles the complete development lifecycle from initial concept to implementation.

## Variables

- Folders, Files and Indexes are stored in `.ai-ley/shared/variables/folder-structure.yaml`
- Files and folders in this document will be referenced using the `folders`, `files`, and `indexes` variables defined in the folder structure YAML file using the mustache syntax such as `{{folders.plan}}`.

## Workflow Overview

1. **ASK Analysis & Requirements Generation** - Convert ideas to detailed requirements with business case
2. **Creative Enhancement & Suggestion Generation** - Add innovative improvements
3. **Resource Discovery & Generation** - Create missing personas/instructions
4. **Architecture & Design Phase** - Create technical architecture and design documentation
5. **Intelligent Planning** - Generate actionable plans with JIRA compatibility and Gantt charts
6. **Execution with Quality Gates** - Implement with continuous monitoring
7. **Optimization & Cleanup** - Refine and maintain system health

## Phase 6: Execution

### Step 6.1: Intelligent Task Execution

````markdown
**Follow systematic execution protocol using intelligent model selection**:

1. **Task Selection and Model Routing**

   - Navigate to `{{folders.plan}}/epics/epic-XXX/story-XXX/`
   - Select next available task (check dependencies)
   - Analyze task complexity, style, and requirements using TaskAnalyzer
   - Route to optimal model using ModelRouter
   - Validate model choice against task characteristics

2. **Model Selection Integration**

   ```python
   # Use the intelligent model selector
   analyzer = TaskAnalyzer()
   router = ModelRouter()

   task_analysis = analyzer.analyze_task(
       description="task description",
       files=["relevant/files.py"],
       context="task context"
   )

   model_selection = router.select_model(task_analysis)
   ```
````

3. **One Task at a Time Protocol**

   - Execute only one sub-task at a time
   - Update task status in `task-XXX-[name].md`
   - Mark tasks as `[x]` immediately upon completion
   - Update `README.md` files in story and epic folders
   - Seek user approval before starting next task
   - Wait for "yes"/"y" confirmation to proceed

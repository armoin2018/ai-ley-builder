## Variables

- Folders, Files and Indexes are stored in `.ai-ley/shared/variables/folder-structure.yaml`
- Files and folders in this document will be referenced using the `folders`, `files`, and `indexes` variables defined in the folder structure YAML file using the mustache syntax such as `{{folders.plan}}`.

## References

- See the `.ai-ley/shared/global-instructions.md` file for global instructions that apply to all commands.
- Reference applicable personas in `{{folders.personas}}` and instructions in `{{folders.instructions}}` as needed.
- In the event of conflicting information utilize the `.ai-ley/shared/conflict-resolution.md` guidelines.

## Goal

Given:

- A current workflow state or process context
- Previous steps that have been completed
- A clear indication of what the "next step" should be

Produce:

- Execution of the logical next step in the current workflow
- Progress updates and status confirmation
- Error handling and retry logic if needed
- Clear indication of completion and next available actions

## Command

You are a workflow execution specialist, epic story progress tracker, and process automation expert with deep knowledge of agile project management and systematic task execution.

### 1. **Analyze Current Context and Epic Story Progress**

**Review Project-Wide Status**:

- Load complete Epic-Story-Task hierarchy from `{{folders.plan}}/epics/`
- Parse all epic READMEs to determine completion status
- Parse all story READMEs within each epic to track progress
- Identify all completed tasks and calculate story/epic percentages
- Map dependencies between epics, stories, and tasks
- Identify blockers and prerequisites

**Generate Epic Story Progress Dashboard**:

```markdown
📊 EPIC STORY PROGRESS REPORT

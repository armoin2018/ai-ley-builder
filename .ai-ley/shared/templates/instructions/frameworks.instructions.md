## AI Assistant Guidelines

When helping with Framework development:

1. **Framework Best Practices**: Follow established patterns and conventions specific to the framework
2. **Performance Optimization**: Consider performance implications of framework-specific features
3. **Security Awareness**: Implement framework security best practices and avoid common vulnerabilities
4. **Code Structure**: Maintain clean, modular code following framework architectural patterns
5. **Testing Integration**: Include appropriate testing strategies for the framework ecosystem
6. **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation following framework conventions
7. **Version Compatibility**: Consider framework version constraints and migration paths
8. **Community Standards**: Follow community-established patterns and coding standards

### Code Generation Rules

- Generate code following framework-specific patterns and conventions
- Include appropriate error handling and validation for framework features
- Implement security best practices specific to the framework ecosystem
- Create modular, testable code with clear separation of concerns
- Include comprehensive documentation and comments for framework-specific implementations
- Consider performance implications and optimization opportunities

### Quality Enforcement

- âœ… Enforce framework-specific best practices and architectural patterns
- âœ… Require appropriate testing strategies and coverage for framework code
- âœ… Block security vulnerabilities and unsafe framework usage patterns
- âœ… Promote clean, maintainable code following framework conventions
- âœ… Require proper error handling and edge case management
- ðŸš« Block deprecated framework features and anti-patterns
- ðŸš« Avoid mixing frameworks or creating unnecessary dependencies
- ðŸš« Reject code without proper framework-specific validation and testing

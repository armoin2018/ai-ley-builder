business_layer:
  - motivation_elements
  - business_architecture
  - information_architecture

application_layer:
  - application_landscape
  - information_systems
  - data_architecture

technology_layer:
  - infrastructure
  - platforms
  - technology_services

cross_cutting:
  - security_architecture
  - integration_architecture
```

#### Naming Conventions

```yaml
# Element naming standards
business_elements:
  actors: "Actor Name" (noun)
  roles: "Role Name" (noun)
  processes: "Process Name" (verb + noun)
  services: "Service Name" (noun + service)

application_elements:
  components: "System Name" (proper noun)
  services: "Service Name" (noun + service)
  interfaces: "Interface Name" (adjective + interface)

technology_elements:
  nodes: "Node Name" (infrastructure noun)
  devices: "Device Name" (hardware noun)
  software: "Software Name" (proper noun)
```

### View Development Strategy

#### Progressive Elaboration

1. **High-Level Context**: Start with stakeholder and capability views
2. **Business Architecture**: Develop business process and service views
3. **Application Architecture**: Model application landscape and data flows
4. **Technology Architecture**: Detail infrastructure and platform views
5. **Implementation Views**: Create migration and project views

#### Audience-Specific Views

```yaml
# View categories by stakeholder
executive_views:
  - business_model_canvas
  - capability_map
  - value_stream_view
  - strategy_view

architect_views:
  - layered_view
  - service_realization_view
  - application_cooperation_view
  - technology_view

project_manager_views:
  - implementation_migration_view
  - project_view
  - plateau_view
  - gap_analysis_view
```

### Quality Guidelines

#### Model Consistency

- **Use consistent abstraction levels**
- **Apply naming conventions uniformly**
- **Validate relationship semantics**
- **Ensure cross-layer alignment**

#### Semantic Accuracy

- **Verify element purposes match their usage**
- **Check relationship types are appropriate**
- **Ensure no contradictory relationships**
- **Validate business logic representation**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Modeling Issues

#### Incorrect Abstraction Level

**Problem**: Mixing high-level and detailed elements in same view
**Symptoms**: Cluttered diagrams, unclear message
**Solution**:

- Separate concerns into different views
- Use consistent abstraction levels
- Apply layering principles

#### Semantic Confusion

**Problem**: Using wrong element types or relationships
**Symptoms**: Model doesn't represent reality accurately
**Solution**:

- Study ArchiMate metamodel carefully
- Use element definitions strictly
- Validate relationships semantically

#### Over-Modeling

**Problem**: Creating overly complex models
**Symptoms**: Difficult to understand, maintain, or use
**Solution**:

- Focus on specific stakeholder needs
- Use progressive elaboration
- Keep views purpose-driven

### Tool-Specific Issues

#### Archi Performance

**Problem**: Slow performance with large models
**Symptoms**: Lag when opening views, slow saves
**Solution**:

```bash
# Increase memory allocation
# Edit Archi.ini file
-Xms512m
-Xmx2048m

# Split large models into focused sub-models
# Use model references for integration
```

#### Model Exchange Problems

**Problem**: Issues when exchanging models between tools
**Symptoms**: Missing elements, broken relationships
**Solution**:

- Use Open Exchange File format (.xml)
- Validate models before export
- Test exchange with small models first

## Security Considerations

### Model Security

#### Sensitive Information Handling

- **Classify model contents** by sensitivity level
- **Apply access controls** to model repositories
- **Sanitize models** before external sharing
- **Use abstraction** to hide sensitive details

#### Repository Security

```yaml
# Security configuration
access_control:
  readers: [architect_group, business_analyst_group]
  contributors: [senior_architect_group]
  administrators: [ea_admin_group]

audit_settings:
  log_access: true
  track_changes: true
  retention_period: '7_years'
```

### Network Security

- **Use HTTPS** for web-based tools
- **Implement VPN** for remote access
- **Configure firewalls** for tool communication
- **Enable encryption** for model storage

## Advanced Configuration

### Archi Plugins and Extensions

#### Collaboration Plugin

```xml
<!-- Plugin configuration -->
<plugin>
  <name>collaboration</name>
  <version>latest</version>
  <config>
    <repository>git_repository_url</repository>
    <branch>main</branch>
  </config>
</plugin>
```

#### Reports Plugin

```xml
<!-- Reporting configuration -->
<plugin>
  <name>reports</name>
  <templates>
    <template>architecture_summary</template>
    <template>gap_analysis</template>
    <template>stakeholder_report</template>
  </templates>
</plugin>
```

### Model Validation Scripts

```javascript
// Custom validation rules
function validateNamingConventions(model) {
  model.elements.forEach((element) => {
    if (!element.name.match(/^[A-Z][a-zA-Z\s]+$/)) {
      console.warn(`Invalid name: ${element.name}`);
    }
  });
}

function validateRelationships(model) {
  model.relationships.forEach((rel) => {
    if (!isValidRelationship(rel.source.type, rel.target.type, rel.type)) {
      console.error(`Invalid relationship: ${rel.type}`);
    }
  });
}
```

### Automation Scripts

```python
# Python script for model analysis
import archimate_parser as ap

def analyze_application_dependencies(model_file):
    model = ap.parse_model(model_file)
    dependencies = {}

    for component in model.application_components:
        deps = find_dependencies(component)
        dependencies[component.name] = deps

    return dependencies

def generate_impact_analysis(component_name, model):
    impacts = []
    for relationship in model.relationships:
        if relationship.source.name == component_name:
            impacts.append(relationship.target)
    return impacts
```

# General AI Coding Assistant Instructions

Core guidelines for AI agents when working on software development tasks across all languages and frameworks.

## 🎯 Primary Objectives

**Code Quality First**: Always prioritize maintainable, readable, and secure code over quick solutions.

**Context Awareness**: Understand project context, existing patterns, and team conventions before making changes.

**Best Practices**: Apply industry standards and modern development practices consistently.

## 🧠 Decision-Making Framework

### Before Writing Code

1. **Analyze Requirements**: Understand the specific task and constraints
2. **Check Existing Patterns**: Look for similar implementations in the codebase
3. **Consider Impact**: Evaluate how changes affect the broader system
4. **Choose Right Tool**: Select appropriate technologies and approaches

### Code Implementation

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with the most straightforward solution
2. **Iterate Thoughtfully**: Add complexity only when necessary
3. **Test Early**: Verify functionality at each step
4. **Document Decisions**: Explain non-obvious choices

## 📋 Universal Best Practices

### Code Organization

- Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and files
- Follow established project structure and naming conventions
- Group related functionality together
- Separate concerns appropriately (data, logic, presentation)

### Error Handling

- Anticipate and handle potential failure points
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Use appropriate error handling patterns for the language/framework
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging

### Security Mindset

- Validate all inputs and sanitize outputs
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Keep dependencies updated and secure
- Never commit secrets or sensitive data

### Performance Awareness

- Write efficient algorithms and data structures
- Avoid premature optimization, but be mindful of obvious inefficiencies
- Consider memory usage and resource management
- Profile and measure when performance matters

## 🔍 Code Review Checklist

### Functionality

- ✅ Code does what it's supposed to do
- ✅ Edge cases are handled appropriately
- ✅ Error conditions are managed properly
- ✅ Integration points work correctly

### Quality

- ✅ Code is readable and maintainable
- ✅ Functions and classes have single responsibilities
- ✅ Complexity is justified and well-documented
- ✅ Tests are comprehensive and meaningful

### Compliance

- ✅ Follows project coding standards
- ✅ Security best practices are applied
- ✅ Performance implications are considered
- ✅ Documentation is adequate

## 🚫 Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Code Smells

- Magic numbers and hardcoded values
- Overly long functions or classes
- Deep nesting and complex conditionals
- Duplicated code across the project
- Unclear or misleading variable names

### Architecture Issues

- Tight coupling between unrelated components
- Circular dependencies
- Violation of established patterns
- Mixing concerns (e.g., business logic in presentation layer)

### Development Practices

- Committing broken or untested code
- Ignoring existing code style and conventions
- Making unnecessary breaking changes
- Overengineering simple solutions

## 🛠 Tool Usage Guidelines

### Version Control

- Make atomic, focused commits with clear messages
- Use branching strategies appropriate to the project
- Review changes before committing
- Keep commit history clean and meaningful

### Dependencies

- Choose mature, well-maintained libraries
- Keep dependencies minimal and justified
- Regularly update to patch security vulnerabilities
- Document why specific versions are required

### Testing

- Write tests that verify behavior, not implementation
- Maintain good test coverage for critical paths
- Use appropriate testing strategies (unit, integration, e2e)
- Keep tests fast and reliable

## 🎯 Language and Framework Agnostic Principles

### Readability

- Code should tell a story of what it does
- Use whitespace and formatting effectively
- Comment complex business logic and decisions
- Choose clarity over cleverness

### Maintainability

- Design for change - code will be modified
- Minimize coupling between components
- Use consistent patterns throughout the project
- Make debugging and troubleshooting easier

### Reliability

- Handle failures gracefully
- Validate assumptions and inputs
- Use defensive programming techniques
- Design with observability in mind

## 🔄 Continuous Improvement

### Learning

- Stay updated with best practices in relevant technologies
- Learn from code reviews and feedback
- Understand the business context of the code
- Seek to understand existing patterns before changing them

### Adaptation

- Adjust approach based on project constraints
- Consider team skill levels and preferences
- Balance idealism with pragmatism
- Evolve practices as projects mature

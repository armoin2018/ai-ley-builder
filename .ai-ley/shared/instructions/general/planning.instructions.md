# Software Project Planning Instructions

## Overview
- **Domain**: Software Project Planning and Management
- **Purpose**: Guide systematic planning, estimation, and execution of software development projects
- **Applicable To**: All software development projects from small features to large systems
- **Integration Level**: Core project management methodology affecting all development phases

## Core Principles

### Fundamental Concepts
1. **Iterative Planning**: Plans evolve with understanding and changing requirements
2. **Evidence-Based Estimation**: Use historical data and multiple estimation techniques
3. **Risk-Driven Planning**: Identify and mitigate risks early in the planning process
4. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Ensure all stakeholders understand scope, timeline, and constraints

### Key Benefits
- Improved project predictability and delivery success rates
- Better resource allocation and team coordination
- Early identification and mitigation of project risks
- Clear communication of expectations and progress
- Enhanced ability to adapt to changing requirements

### Common Misconceptions
- **Myth**: Detailed upfront planning eliminates all uncertainty
  **Reality**: Planning reduces uncertainty but must accommodate change
- **Myth**: Agile projects don't need formal planning
  **Reality**: Agile requires different planning approaches, not less planning
- **Myth**: Plans are commitments that cannot change
  **Reality**: Plans are tools for coordination that should evolve with new information

## Implementation Framework

### Getting Started
#### Prerequisites
- Clear understanding of project objectives and success criteria
- Stakeholder identification and availability for planning sessions
- Access to historical project data for estimation
- Understanding of organizational constraints and processes

#### Initial Setup
1. **Project Charter**: Define purpose, scope, objectives, and high-level constraints
2. **Stakeholder Mapping**: Identify all stakeholders and their roles/responsibilities
3. **Planning Tools**: Select appropriate planning and tracking tools
4. **Team Formation**: Assemble planning team with appropriate skills and authority

### Core Methodologies
#### Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
- **Purpose**: Decompose project scope into manageable, estimable components
- **When to Use**: All projects requiring detailed planning and resource allocation
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Start with high-level deliverables and major components
  2. Decompose each component into smaller, manageable work packages
  3. Continue until work packages are 8-80 hours of effort
  4. Validate completeness and eliminate overlaps
- **Success Metrics**: All work packages are estimable, assignable, and measurable

#### Three-Point Estimation
- **Purpose**: Provide realistic estimates that account for uncertainty
- **When to Use**: When uncertainty exists in scope, complexity, or dependencies
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Estimate optimistic (best case) duration/effort
  2. Estimate pessimistic (worst case) duration/effort
  3. Estimate most likely (realistic) duration/effort
  4. Calculate expected value: (Optimistic + 4×Most Likely + Pessimistic) ÷ 6
- **Success Metrics**: Estimates fall within confidence intervals on completed work

### Process Integration
#### Development Workflow Integration
```bash
# Example planning integration with development
git checkout -b planning/epic-user-management
# Create planning documents
mkdir -p docs/planning/epics/user-management
echo "# User Management Epic Planning" > docs/planning/epics/user-management/overview.md
echo "## Work Breakdown" > docs/planning/epics/user-management/wbs.md
echo "## Risk Assessment" > docs/planning/epics/user-management/risks.md

# Link planning to implementation
git commit -m "feat: add user management epic planning

- Defines scope and work breakdown structure

### Pattern 2: Capacity Planning
**Scenario**: Planning team capacity and resource allocation across multiple projects
**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Team capacity planning calculator
class CapacityPlanner {
  constructor(teamMembers, sprintLength = 14) {
    this.teamMembers = teamMembers;
    this.sprintLength = sprintLength; // days
    this.workingHoursPerDay = 8;
    this.focusFactors = {
      developer: 0.75, // 75% coding time
      tester: 0.80,    // 80% testing time
      designer: 0.70,  // 70% design time
      pm: 0.60         // 60% project work time
    };
  }

  calculateSprintCapacity(teamMember) {
    const availableDays = this.sprintLength - teamMember.timeOff;
    const totalHours = availableDays * this.workingHoursPerDay;
    const focusFactor = this.focusFactors[teamMember.role] || 0.75;
    
    return {
      member: teamMember.name,
      role: teamMember.role,
      totalHours: totalHours,
      focusedHours: Math.floor(totalHours * focusFactor),
      storyPoints: this.hoursToStoryPoints(totalHours * focusFactor, teamMember.role)
    };
  }

  hoursToStoryPoints(hours, role) {
    // Convert hours to story points based on role and historical velocity
    const roleMultipliers = {
      developer: 0.4,  // 1 story point = 2.5 hours
      tester: 0.5,     // 1 story point = 2 hours  
      designer: 0.3,   // 1 story point = 3.3 hours
      pm: 0.2          // 1 story point = 5 hours
    };
    
    return Math.floor(hours * (roleMultipliers[role] || 0.4));
  }

  planSprint() {
    const capacities = this.teamMembers.map(member => 
      this.calculateSprintCapacity(member)
    );
    
    const totalCapacity = capacities.reduce((sum, cap) => ({
      hours: sum.hours + cap.focusedHours,
      points: sum.points + cap.storyPoints
    }), { hours: 0, points: 0 });

    return {
      individual: capacities,
      team: totalCapacity,
      recommendations: this.getCapacityRecommendations(totalCapacity)
    };
  }

  getCapacityRecommendations(capacity) {
    const recommendations = [];
    
    if (capacity.points < 20) {
      recommendations.push("Low capacity sprint - focus on high-priority items only");
    }
    
    if (capacity.points > 40) {
      recommendations.push("High capacity - consider taking on stretch goals");
    }
    
    recommendations.push(`Reserve ${Math.ceil(capacity.points * 0.2)} points for unexpected work`);
    
    return recommendations;
  }
}

// Usage example
const team = [
  { name: "Alice", role: "developer", timeOff: 1 },
  { name: "Bob", role: "developer", timeOff: 0 },
  { name: "Carol", role: "tester", timeOff: 2 },
  { name: "Dave", role: "designer", timeOff: 0 }
];

const planner = new CapacityPlanner(team);
const sprintPlan = planner.planSprint();
console.log("Sprint Capacity Plan:", sprintPlan);
```
**Expected Outcomes**: Realistic sprint planning based on actual team availability

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
#### Anti-Pattern 1: Over-Planning
- **Description**: Creating overly detailed plans that become outdated quickly
- **Why It's Problematic**: Wastes time and creates false confidence in predictability
- **Better Approach**: Plan in detail for near-term work, outline for longer-term items

#### Anti-Pattern 2: Planning in Isolation
- **Description**: Creating plans without input from implementation team

4. Review historical estimation accuracy and adjust accordingly
**Prevention**: Regular estimation calibration and retrospective analysis

#### Issue 2: Scope Creep and Changing Requirements
**Symptoms**: Project timeline extends, budget overruns, team frustration
**Root Causes**: Unclear initial requirements, stakeholder pressure, poor change control
**Solutions**:
1. Implement formal change request process with impact assessment
2. Regular stakeholder communication and expectation management
3. Time-box requirement exploration and defer non-critical changes
4. Maintain clear documentation of what's in and out of scope
**Prevention**: Detailed requirements gathering and stakeholder alignment upfront

### Escalation Procedures

# Software Troubleshooting Instructions

## Overview
- **Domain**: Software Problem Diagnosis and Resolution
- **Purpose**: Systematic approach to identifying, diagnosing, and resolving software issues
- **Applicable To**: All software systems, from development to production environments
- **Integration Level**: Critical operational skill affecting system reliability and user experience

## Core Principles

### Fundamental Concepts
1. **Systematic Approach**: Follow structured methodology to avoid missing critical steps
2. **Reproduce First**: Consistently reproduce issues before attempting fixes
3. **Minimal Changes**: Make one change at a time to isolate cause and effect
4. **Document Everything**: Record symptoms, steps, and resolutions for future reference

### Key Benefits
- Faster problem resolution with systematic approach
- Reduced downtime and improved system reliability
- Knowledge accumulation for preventing future issues
- Better team collaboration through shared troubleshooting practices
- Improved customer satisfaction through quick issue resolution

### Common Misconceptions
- **Myth**: Experienced developers don't need systematic troubleshooting
  **Reality**: Complex systems require structured approaches regardless of experience
- **Myth**: Quick fixes are better than thorough investigation
  **Reality**: Understanding root causes prevents recurring issues
- **Myth**: Troubleshooting is only for production issues
  **Reality**: Development and testing environments benefit from systematic debugging

## Implementation Framework

### Getting Started
#### Prerequisites
- Access to relevant logs, monitoring tools, and system documentation
- Understanding of system architecture and component interactions
- Basic knowledge of debugging tools and techniques
- Permission to access and modify relevant systems and configurations

#### Initial Setup
1. **Tool Preparation**: Set up logging, monitoring, and debugging tools
2. **Documentation Access**: Ensure access to system documentation and runbooks
3. **Communication Channels**: Establish incident communication procedures
4. **Escalation Paths**: Define when and how to escalate issues

### Core Methodologies
#### Root Cause Analysis (RCA)
- **Purpose**: Identify underlying causes rather than treating symptoms
- **When to Use**: For recurring issues, critical system failures, or post-incident analysis
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Define the problem clearly with specific symptoms
  2. Collect evidence and data about the issue
  3. Map the sequence of events leading to the problem
  4. Identify potential causes using techniques like "5 Whys"
  5. Test hypotheses and validate root causes
  6. Implement corrective and preventive actions
- **Success Metrics**: Issues don't recur, preventive measures are implemented

#### Binary Search Debugging
- **Purpose**: Efficiently narrow down the source of issues in large codebases
- **When to Use**: When dealing with large systems or recent changes causing issues
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Identify the working and non-working states
  2. Find a midpoint between the two states
  3. Test the midpoint to determine which half contains the issue
  4. Repeat the process on the problematic half
  5. Continue until the exact cause is isolated
- **Success Metrics**: Problem source identified with minimal testing

### Process Integration
#### Development Workflow Integration
```bash
# Example debugging workflow with version control
git log --oneline -10  # Check recent changes
git bisect start
git bisect bad HEAD    # Current state is bad
git bisect good <known-good-commit>  # Last known good state

# Git will checkout commits for testing
# After each test:
git bisect good   # if test passes
git bisect bad    # if test fails

# When done:
git bisect reset
```

#### Monitoring Integration
```yaml
# Example monitoring and alerting setup
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    image: myapp:latest
    logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
        max-size: "10m"
        max-file: "3"
    environment:
      - LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
      - ENABLE_PROFILING=true
    labels:
      - "prometheus.io/scrape=true"
      - "prometheus.io/port=3000"
      - "prometheus.io/path=/metrics"

  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus
    volumes:
      - ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
    ports:
      - "9090:9090"

  grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin
```

#### Documentation Requirements

## Best Practices

### Issue Classification and Prioritization
#### Severity Classification Framework
```javascript
// Issue severity classification system
const severityLevels = {
  P0_CRITICAL: {
    description: "Complete system outage or data loss",
    responseTime: "15 minutes",
    examples: [
      "Production system completely down",
      "Data corruption or loss",
      "Security breach affecting user data",
      "Payment processing failures"
    ],
    escalation: "Immediate executive notification",
    resources: "All hands on deck"
  },
  
  P1_HIGH: {
    description: "Major functionality broken, workaround exists",
    responseTime: "1 hour",
    examples: [
      "Key feature not working but system accessible",
      "Performance degradation >50%",
      "Intermittent payment failures",
      "Authentication issues for some users"
    ],
    escalation: "Manager notification within 30 minutes",
    resources: "Primary on-call engineer"
  },
  
  P2_MEDIUM: {
    description: "Minor functionality issues",
    responseTime: "4 hours",
    examples: [
      "Non-critical feature bugs",
      "UI display issues",
      "Minor performance issues",
      "Documentation errors"
    ],
    escalation: "Standard ticket routing",
    resources: "Standard support queue"
  },
  
  P3_LOW: {
    description: "Enhancement requests or minor bugs",
    responseTime: "24 hours",
    examples: [
      "Feature requests",
      "Cosmetic issues",
      "Nice-to-have improvements",

    ],
    escalation: "Product team review",
    resources: "Next sprint planning"
  }
};

function classifyIssue(issue) {
  const impactScore = calculateImpact(issue);
  const urgencyScore = calculateUrgency(issue);
  
  // Priority matrix
  if (impactScore >= 9 || urgencyScore >= 9) return severityLevels.P0_CRITICAL;
  if (impactScore >= 7 || urgencyScore >= 7) return severityLevels.P1_HIGH;
  if (impactScore >= 5 || urgencyScore >= 5) return severityLevels.P2_MEDIUM;
  return severityLevels.P3_LOW;
}
```

- [ ] **Status Page**: Updated if customer-facing
- [ ] **Stakeholder Notification**: Internal teams notified
- [ ] **Customer Communication**: Prepared if external impact
```

### Systematic Debugging Approach
#### The TRACE Method
```markdown
# TRACE Debugging Methodology

## T - Track the Problem
- **Reproduce**: Can you consistently reproduce the issue?
- **Environment**: What environment(s) does this occur in?
- **Timing**: When did this start? Is it constant or intermittent?
- **Scope**: Who/what is affected? What works correctly?

## R - Research and Gather Information
- **Logs**: Check application, system, and error logs
- **Metrics**: Review performance and resource utilization
- **Recent Changes**: What changed recently? (deployments, config, etc.)
- **External Factors**: Network issues, third-party service problems?

## A - Analyze the Data
- **Patterns**: Are there patterns in the failures?
- **Correlations**: Do errors correlate with specific conditions?
- **Timeline**: Map events chronologically
- **Dependencies**: What systems/services are involved?

## C - Create Hypotheses
- **Root Cause Theories**: What could be causing this?
- **Testable Hypotheses**: Form specific, testable theories
- **Prioritization**: Order hypotheses by likelihood and impact
- **Test Plan**: How will you test each hypothesis?

## E - Execute Tests and Evaluate
- **Controlled Testing**: Test one hypothesis at a time
- **Measure Results**: Did the test confirm or refute the hypothesis?
- **Document Findings**: Record what you learned
- **Iterate**: Refine hypotheses based on results
```

#### Log Analysis Framework
```bash
# Comprehensive log analysis workflow

# 1. Identify relevant log sources
LOG_SOURCES=(
  "/var/log/application/app.log"
  "/var/log/nginx/access.log" 
  "/var/log/nginx/error.log"
  "/var/log/mysql/error.log"
  "/var/log/syslog"
)

# 2. Define time window of interest
START_TIME="2024-01-15 14:00:00"
END_TIME="2024-01-15 15:00:00"

# 3. Extract logs for time window
for log_file in "${LOG_SOURCES[@]}"; do
  echo "=== Analyzing $log_file ==="
  
  # Extract time-windowed logs
  awk -v start="$START_TIME" -v end="$END_TIME" '
    $0 >= start && $0 <= end {print}
  ' "$log_file" > "filtered_$(basename $log_file)"
  
  # Count error patterns
  grep -i error "filtered_$(basename $log_file)" | \
    cut -d' ' -f5- | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
  
  # Check for common issues
  echo "--- Connection Issues ---"
  grep -i "connection\|timeout\|refused" "filtered_$(basename $log_file)"
  
  echo "--- Memory Issues ---"
  grep -i "memory\|oom\|out of memory" "filtered_$(basename $log_file)"
  
  echo "--- Performance Issues ---"
  grep -i "slow\|performance\|timeout" "filtered_$(basename $log_file)"
done

# 4. Cross-reference logs for correlation
echo "=== Cross-referencing logs ==="
# Find common timestamps across error logs
grep -h "ERROR\|FATAL" filtered_*.log | \
  cut -d' ' -f1-2 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -10
```

### Performance Troubleshooting
#### Application Performance Analysis
```javascript

    this.appName = appName;
    this.metrics = new Map();
    this.thresholds = {
      responseTime: 1000,    // ms

        ]
      });
    }

    if (issues.length > 0) {
      this.triggerAlerts(issues);
    }

    return issues;
  }

  generatePerformanceReport() {
    const recentMetrics = Array.from(this.metrics.values())
      .slice(-100); // Last 100 data points

    return {
      summary: {
        avgResponseTime: this.average(recentMetrics.map(m => m.responseTime)),

## Common Patterns and Examples

### Pattern 1: Database Performance Issues
**Scenario**: Application experiencing slow response times with database-related errors
**Implementation**:
```sql
-- Database performance troubleshooting queries

-- 1. Identify slow queries
SELECT 
    query_time,
    lock_time,
    rows_sent,
    rows_examined,
    sql_text
FROM mysql.slow_log 
WHERE start_time >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 HOUR)
ORDER BY query_time DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- 2. Check for blocking queries
SHOW PROCESSLIST;

-- 3. Analyze index usage
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'user@example.com';

-- 4. Check table locks
SHOW OPEN TABLES WHERE In_use > 0;

-- 5. Monitor connection usage
SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Threads_connected';
SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Max_used_connections';
```

```bash
# System-level database troubleshooting
# Check disk I/O
iostat -x 1 5

# Monitor database processes
top -p $(pgrep mysql)

# Check disk space
df -h /var/lib/mysql

# Analyze MySQL error log
tail -f /var/log/mysql/error.log | grep -E "ERROR|WARNING"
```
**Expected Outcomes**: Identification of slow queries, index issues, or resource constraints

### Pattern 2: Memory Leak Investigation
**Scenario**: Application memory usage continuously increasing over time
**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Memory leak detection and analysis
class MemoryLeakDetector {
  constructor(interval = 30000) { // 30 seconds
    this.interval = interval;
    this.samples = [];
    this.monitoring = false;
  }

  startMonitoring() {
    this.monitoring = true;
    console.log('Starting memory leak detection...');
    
    this.monitoringInterval = setInterval(() => {
      const sample = this.takeSample();
      this.samples.push(sample);
      
      // Keep only last 100 samples
      if (this.samples.length > 100) {
        this.samples.shift();
      }
      
      this.analyzeLeakPattern();
    }, this.interval);
  }

  takeSample() {
    const memUsage = process.memoryUsage();
    return {
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      heapUsed: memUsage.heapUsed,
      heapTotal: memUsage.heapTotal,
      external: memUsage.external,
      rss: memUsage.rss
    };
  }

  analyzeLeakPattern() {
    if (this.samples.length < 10) return;

    const recentSamples = this.samples.slice(-10);
    const firstSample = recentSamples[0];
    const lastSample = recentSamples[recentSamples.length - 1];
    
    const heapGrowth = lastSample.heapUsed - firstSample.heapUsed;
    const timeSpan = lastSample.timestamp - firstSample.timestamp;
    const growthRate = heapGrowth / timeSpan * 1000 * 60; // bytes per minute

    if (growthRate > 1024 * 1024) { // 1MB per minute
      console.warn(`Potential memory leak detected!`);
      console.warn(`Growth rate: ${(growthRate / 1024 / 1024).toFixed(2)} MB/min`);
      
      this.generateHeapSnapshot();
      this.logMemoryDetails();
    }
  }

  generateHeapSnapshot() {
    if (global.gc) {
      global.gc(); // Force garbage collection
      console.log('Forced garbage collection');
    }
    
    // Generate heap snapshot (requires --inspect flag)
    const filename = `heap-${Date.now()}.heapsnapshot`;
    console.log(`Generate heap snapshot: ${filename}`);
    
    // Analyze object counts
    this.analyzeObjectCounts();
  }

  analyzeObjectCounts() {
    // Monkey-patch constructors to track object creation
    const objectCounts = new Map();
    
    const originalObjectCreate = Object.create;
    Object.create = function(...args) {
      const obj = originalObjectCreate.apply(this, args);
      const constructor = obj.constructor.name;
      objectCounts.set(constructor, (objectCounts.get(constructor) || 0) + 1);
      return obj;
    };

    // Log top object types
    setTimeout(() => {
      const sortedCounts = Array.from(objectCounts.entries())
        .sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1])
        .slice(0, 10);
      
      console.log('Top object types:');
      sortedCounts.forEach(([type, count]) => {
        console.log(`  ${type}: ${count}`);
      });
    }, 5000);
  }

  stopMonitoring() {
    this.monitoring = false;
    if (this.monitoringInterval) {
      clearInterval(this.monitoringInterval);
    }
    console.log('Memory leak detection stopped');
  }
}

// Usage
const detector = new MemoryLeakDetector();
detector.startMonitoring();

// Stop monitoring after 10 minutes
setTimeout(() => detector.stopMonitoring(), 10 * 60 * 1000);
```
**Expected Outcomes**: Detection of memory growth patterns and identification of potential leak sources

  constructor(config) {
    this.encryptionKey = config.encryptionKey;
    this.retentionPolicy = config.retentionPolicy;
    this.auditLogger = config.auditLogger;
  }
  
  // GDPR-compliant data collection
  collectUserData(userData, consent) {
    // Validate explicit consent
    if (!this.validateConsent(consent)) {
      throw new Error('Invalid or missing user consent');
    }
    
    // Log data collection for audit trail
    this.auditLogger.log({
      action: 'DATA_COLLECTION',
      userId: userData.userId,
      dataTypes: Object.keys(userData),
      consentId: consent.id,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      legalBasis: consent.legalBasis
    });
    
    // Encrypt sensitive data before storage
    const encryptedData = this.encryptSensitiveFields(userData);
    
    // Set retention schedule
    this.scheduleDataRetention(userData.userId, this.retentionPolicy);
    
    return encryptedData;
  }
  
  // Data subject rights implementation
  async processDataSubjectRequest(userId, requestType) {
    this.auditLogger.log({
      action: 'DATA_SUBJECT_REQUEST',
      userId: userId,
      requestType: requestType,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    });
    
    switch (requestType) {
      case 'ACCESS':
        return await this.exportUserData(userId);
      case 'DELETION':
        return await this.deleteUserData(userId);
      case 'PORTABILITY':
        return await this.exportPortableData(userId);
      default:

## Common Patterns and Examples

### Pattern 1: GDPR Compliance Implementation
**Scenario**: Web application handling EU user data requiring GDPR compliance
**Implementation**:
```javascript
// GDPR-compliant user registration system
class GDPRCompliantUserService {
  async registerUser(userData, consentData) {
    try {
      // Validate explicit consent
      const validConsent = await this.validateGDPRConsent(consentData);
      if (!validConsent) {
        throw new ComplianceError('GDPR consent validation failed');
      }
      
      // Log consent for audit trail
      await this.auditLogger.log({
        action: 'CONSENT_RECORDED',
        userId: userData.email,
        consentDetails: consentData,
        legalBasis: 'consent',
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
      });
      
      // Encrypt personal data
      const encryptedUserData = await this.encryptPersonalData(userData);
      
      // Store with retention metadata
      const user = await this.userRepository.create({
        ...encryptedUserData,
        gdprMetadata: {
          consentId: validConsent.id,
          dataRetentionUntil: this.calculateRetentionDate(),
          processingPurposes: consentData.purposes
        }
      });
      
      return { userId: user.id, complianceStatus: 'GDPR_COMPLIANT' };
      
    } catch (error) {
      await this.auditLogger.log({
        action: 'COMPLIANCE_VIOLATION',
        error: error.message,
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
      });
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```

    @Autowired
    private ApprovalWorkflow approvalWorkflow;
    
    @SOXAuditTrail
    @Transactional
    public TransactionResult processTransaction(TransactionRequest request) {
        try {
            // Validate user authorization
            if (!securityService.hasAuthorization(request.getUserId(), "PROCESS_TRANSACTION")) {
                throw new SOXComplianceException("Insufficient authorization for transaction processing");
            }
            
            // Log transaction initiation
            auditLogger.logSOXEvent(SOXEventType.TRANSACTION_INITIATED, request);
            
            // Require dual approval for large transactions
            if (request.getAmount().compareTo(SOX_THRESHOLD) > 0) {
                ApprovalResult approval = approvalWorkflow.requireDualApproval(request);
                if (!approval.isApproved()) {
                    auditLogger.logSOXEvent(SOXEventType.TRANSACTION_REJECTED, request);
                    throw new SOXComplianceException("Transaction requires dual approval");
                }
            }
            
            // Process transaction with segregation of duties
            TransactionResult result = transactionProcessor.process(request);
            
            // Generate SOX-compliant audit trail
            auditLogger.logSOXEvent(SOXEventType.TRANSACTION_COMPLETED, result);
            
            return result;
            
        } catch (Exception e) {
            auditLogger.logSOXEvent(SOXEventType.TRANSACTION_FAILED, request, e);
            throw new SOXComplianceException("Transaction processing failed: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

# Foundation CSS Framework Instructions

## Framework Overview

- **Framework Name**: Foundation for Sites
- **Version**: 6.8+ (Latest stable with modern features)
- **Type**: CSS Framework for responsive web development
- **Language**: Sass/SCSS, JavaScript, HTML
- **Use Cases**: Professional websites, web applications, mobile-first responsive design, accessibility-focused projects

## When to Use Foundation

### ✅ **Use Foundation When**

- Building professional websites requiring advanced responsive design capabilities
- Need comprehensive accessibility features built-in (WCAG compliance)
- Working with teams familiar with Sass and advanced CSS methodologies
- Require flexible grid system with advanced customization options
- Building complex web applications with sophisticated UI components
- Need extensive JavaScript component library (dropdowns, modals, tabs)
- Working on projects requiring RTL (right-to-left) language support
- Developing websites that need semantic HTML structure
- Require advanced form validation and input handling

### ❌ **Avoid Foundation When**

- Need rapid prototyping with minimal setup (Bootstrap may be faster)
- Working with designers unfamiliar with Foundation's methodology
- Project has very specific design requirements that conflict with Foundation's approach
- Team prefers utility-first CSS approach (Tailwind CSS would be better)
- Building simple static websites that don't need advanced components
- Performance is critical and bundle size must be minimal
- Need extensive third-party theme ecosystem

### Project Type Assessment

| Project Type        | Foundation Recommendation                                               | Alternative                     |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Corporate Website   | ✅ **Strongly Recommended** - Professional components and accessibility | Bootstrap 5                     |
| E-commerce Platform | ✅ **Recommended** - Advanced forms and responsive grids                | Tailwind CSS                    |
| Web Application     | ✅ **Recommended** - Rich component library                             | React component libraries       |
| Marketing Site      | 🔄 **Consider** - May be overkill for simple sites                      | Bootstrap or Tailwind           |
| Portfolio Site      | 🔄 **Consider** - Advanced features may not be needed                   | Custom CSS or lighter framework |
| Mobile App (Hybrid) | ✅ **Recommended** - Mobile-first approach                              | Framework7                      |

### Complexity Assessment

| Factor             | Low Complexity     | Medium Complexity      | High Complexity                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Setup Time**     | 30 minutes (CDN)   | 2 hours (custom build) | 4+ hours (advanced customization) |
| **Learning Curve** | HTML/CSS knowledge | Sass familiarity       | Advanced Sass + JavaScript        |
| **Customization**  | Theme variables    | Custom components      | Complete design system            |
| **Build Process**  | None (CDN)         | Basic Sass compilation | Webpack/Gulp with optimization    |

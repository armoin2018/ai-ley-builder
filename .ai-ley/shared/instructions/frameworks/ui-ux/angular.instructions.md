# Angular Enterprise Frontend Framework Instructions

## Framework Overview

- **Framework Name**: Angular
- **Version**: 17+ (Latest stable with standalone components, signals, and new control flow)
- **Type**: Enterprise Frontend Framework
- **Language**: TypeScript (primary), JavaScript, HTML, CSS/SCSS
- **Use Cases**: Enterprise applications, large-scale SPAs, progressive web apps, complex business applications

## When to Use Angular

### ✅ **Use Angular When**

- Building large-scale enterprise applications with complex business logic
- Team prefers strongly-typed development with TypeScript-first approach
- Need comprehensive framework with built-in solutions (routing, forms, HTTP, testing)
- Working on applications requiring strict architectural patterns and conventions
- Building applications with complex state management and data flow requirements
- Need excellent tooling support with Angular CLI for scaffolding and development
- Developing progressive web apps with advanced service worker integration
- Working in enterprise environments requiring long-term support and stability
- Building applications with internationalization (i18n) requirements

### ❌ **Avoid Angular When**

- Building simple websites or landing pages that don't need complex interactivity
- Team prefers lightweight solutions or has limited TypeScript experience
- Need fastest possible development iteration for prototypes or MVPs
- Working on projects with tight bundle size constraints
- Team has strong React ecosystem expertise and established toolchain
- Building mobile-first applications where React Native ecosystem is preferred
- Need maximum flexibility in architectural decisions

## AI Agent Decision Matrix

### Project Type Assessment

| Project Type          | Angular Recommendation                           | Key Strengths                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Enterprise Dashboard  | ✅ **Excellent** - Built for complex UIs         | Data tables, forms, charts   |
| Admin Panel           | ✅ **Ideal** - CRUD operations and permissions   | Role-based access, forms     |
| Financial Application | ✅ **Perfect** - Complex business logic          | Type safety, RxJS streams    |
| E-commerce Platform   | ✅ **Recommended** - Feature-rich requirements   | PWA, i18n, performance       |
| Content Website       | 🔄 **Overkill** - Too complex for simple content | Consider Next.js, Nuxt       |
| Mobile-first App      | 🔄 **Consider** - Ionic for hybrid approach      | React Native might be better |

### Team Size and Expertise Assessment

| Team Characteristics      | Angular Suitability                                | Considerations                  |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Large Team (10+)**      | ✅ **Excellent** - Clear structure and conventions | Built-in architectural patterns |
| **Enterprise Experience** | ✅ **Ideal** - Familiar enterprise patterns        | Java/.NET developers adapt well |
| **TypeScript Expertise**  | ✅ **Perfect** - TypeScript-first design           | Leverage existing TS knowledge  |
| **JavaScript-only Team**  | 🔄 **Learning Curve** - TypeScript required        | Consider training investment    |

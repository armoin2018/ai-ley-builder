## Core Concepts

### Event Sheets and Visual Scripting

- **Purpose**: Define game logic through visual programming without traditional code
- **Usage**: Create conditions, actions, and event-driven behavior systems

```text
Event Sheet Structure:

Event 1: System ▶ On start of layout
  ↳ Action: Player ▶ Set position to (100, 100)
  ↳ Action: Audio ▶ Play "bgmusic" (looping)

Event 2: Player ▶ On collision with Enemy
  ↳ Condition: Player ▶ Is animation "running" playing
  ↳ Action: Player ▶ Subtract 1 from health
  ↳ Action: System ▶ Wait 1 second
  ↳ Action: Player ▶ Set position to checkpoint

Event 3: Keyboard ▶ On Space pressed
  ↳ Condition: Player ▶ Is on floor
  ↳ Action: Player ▶ Set Platform vector Y to -400
  ↳ Action: Audio ▶ Play "jump_sound"
```

### Behaviors and Physics

- **Purpose**: Add pre-built functionality to objects without complex event scripting
- **Usage**: Attach behaviors for movement, physics, AI, and interaction patterns

```text
Common Behaviors:

Platform Behavior (Player):
  - Max speed: 200
  - Acceleration: 600
  - Deceleration: 500
  - Jump strength: 400
  - Gravity: 800

Physics Behavior (Objects):
  - Density: 1.0
  - Friction: 0.5
  - Elasticity: 0.3
  - Linear damping: 0.1

Sine Behavior (Floating items):
  - Movement: Vertical
  - Period: 2 seconds
  - Magnitude: 20 pixels

Bullet Behavior (Projectiles):
  - Speed: 300
  - Angle of motion: 0
  - Gravity: 0
  - Bounce off solids: Yes
```

### Layouts and Layers

- **Purpose**: Organize game scenes and visual hierarchy for rendering and interaction
- **Usage**: Structure game screens and implement parallax scrolling, UI overlays

```text
Layout Configuration:

Main Game Layout:
├── Background Layer (Parallax 50%)
│   ├── Sky sprites
│   └── Distant mountains
├── Game Layer (Parallax 100%)
│   ├── Platforms and terrain
│   ├── Player character
│   ├── Enemies and collectibles
│   └── Interactive objects
├── Foreground Layer (Parallax 150%)
│   ├── Foreground details
│   └── Particle effects
└── UI Layer (Parallax 0%)
    ├── Health bar
    ├── Score display
    └── Pause button

Layer Properties:
- Z-order: Bottom to top rendering
- Opacity: 0-100% transparency
- Blend modes: Normal, additive, multiply
- Parallax: Background scrolling effects
- Scale rate: Zoom behavior
```

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do's

- **Organize events logically** - Group related events into separate event sheets
- **Use comments extensively** - Document complex event logic for team understanding
- **Optimize sprite sizes** - Use power-of-2 dimensions for better performance
- **Leverage behaviors** - Use built-in behaviors before creating custom event logic
- **Test across platforms** - Regular testing on target deployment platforms
- **Use object picking** - Efficiently select specific instances in events
- **Implement object pooling** - Reuse objects instead of constantly creating/destroying
- **Structure layouts efficiently** - Minimize unnecessary layers and objects

### ❌ Don'ts

- **Don't create overly complex single events** - Break down into smaller, manageable events
- **Don't ignore performance warnings** - Address memory and CPU usage alerts
- **Don't use too many particles** - Limit particle systems for mobile compatibility
- **Don't forget collision optimization** - Use collision cells and optimize collision checks
- **Don't hardcode values** - Use instance variables and global variables
- **Don't duplicate event logic** - Use functions and includes for reusable code
- **Don't neglect testing** - Regular playtesting prevents major issues

## Common Patterns

### Player Movement System

```text
Event Sheet: Player Movement

Event: Keyboard ▶ Left arrow is down
  ↳ Action: Player ▶ Simulate Platform pressing Left

Event: Keyboard ▶ Right arrow is down
  ↳ Action: Player ▶ Simulate Platform pressing Right

Event: Keyboard ▶ Up arrow is down
  Condition: Player ▶ Platform is on floor
  ↳ Action: Player ▶ Simulate Platform pressing Jump

Event: Player ▶ On collision with Solid
  Condition: Player ▶ Platform is moving
  ↳ Action: Audio ▶ Play "step_sound"

Event: Player ▶ Platform vector X > 0
  ↳ Action: Player ▶ Set mirrored (Horizontal: false)
  ↳ Action: Player ▶ Set animation to "run"

Event: Player ▶ Platform vector X < 0
  ↳ Action: Player ▶ Set mirrored (Horizontal: true)
  ↳ Action: Player ▶ Set animation to "run"

Event: Player ▶ Platform vector X = 0
  ↳ Action: Player ▶ Set animation to "idle"
```

### Enemy AI State Machine

```text
Enemy Instance Variables:
- State (text): "patrol", "chase", "attack", "return"
- PatrolDistance (number): 200
- ChaseRange (number): 150
- Health (number): 3

Event Sheet: Enemy AI

Event: System ▶ Every tick
  Condition: Enemy.State = "patrol"
  ↳ Action: Enemy ▶ Move forward at 50 pixels/second
  ↳ Action: Enemy ▶ If moved PatrolDistance, reverse direction

Event: System ▶ Every tick
  Condition: Distance(Enemy.X, Enemy.Y, Player.X, Player.Y) < Enemy.ChaseRange
  ↳ Action: Enemy ▶ Set State to "chase"
  ↳ Action: Enemy ▶ Set angle toward Player

Event: System ▶ Every tick
  Condition: Enemy.State = "chase"
  Condition: Distance(Enemy.X, Enemy.Y, Player.X, Player.Y) < 50
  ↳ Action: Enemy ▶ Set State to "attack"
  ↳ Action: Enemy ▶ Set animation to "attack"

Event: Enemy ▶ On animation "attack" finished
  ↳ Action: Enemy ▶ Set State to "patrol"
  ↳ Action: Player ▶ Subtract 1 from health
```

## Essential Development Workflow

### 1. Project Setup

```text
New Project Checklist:
✅ Choose appropriate template or start blank
✅ Set project properties (name, description, version)
✅ Configure window size and orientation
✅ Set up physics engine if needed
✅ Import initial sprite assets
✅ Create basic layout structure
✅ Set up main event sheet
```

### 2. Testing and Debugging

```text
Debug Tools:
- Layout preview for visual testing
- Debug mode for runtime inspection
- Performance profiler for optimization
- Browser developer tools for web builds
- Mobile testing via remote preview
- Event sheet debugging with breakpoints
```

### 3. Export and Deployment

```text
Export Options:
HTML5 Web:
- Minify script for production
- Enable service worker for offline play
- Optimize for specific browsers

Mobile (Cordova):
- Configure app icons and splash screens
- Set permissions and features
- Test on actual devices
- Submit to app stores

Desktop (NW.js):
- Package with runtime
- Create installer packages
- Code signing for distribution
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### **Performance Problems**
**Problem**: Game runs slowly on mobile devices
**Solution**: 
- Reduce sprite resolution and animation frames
- Limit concurrent particle effects
- Use object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
- Profile using debug mode to identify bottlenecks

#### **Audio Issues**
**Problem**: Sounds don't play on mobile or web
**Solution**:
- Ensure audio is triggered by user interaction first
- Use compressed audio formats (OGG for web, M4A for mobile)
- Preload important sounds in loading screen
- Check browser audio policy restrictions

#### **Export Failures**
**Problem**: Game doesn't work after export
**Solution**:
- Test with preview mode first
- Check for missing assets or broken file paths
- Verify third-party plugin compatibility
- Review export options and target platform requirements

# Laravel PHP Web Framework Instructions

## Framework Overview

- **Framework Name**: Laravel
- **Version**: 10.x+ (Latest stable with PHP 8.1+ support and improved performance)
- **Type**: Full-Stack PHP Web Framework
- **Language**: PHP, Blade templating, JavaScript, CSS
- **Use Cases**: Web applications, APIs, e-commerce platforms, content management systems, enterprise applications

## When to Use Laravel

### ‚úÖ **Use Laravel When**

- Building full-featured web applications with complex business logic
- Need rapid development with built-in authentication, routing, and ORM
- Team has PHP expertise and prefers mature, well-documented frameworks
- Building APIs that require robust features like rate limiting and API resources
- Need comprehensive testing tools and development environment (Sail, Valet)
- Developing applications requiring real-time features (broadcasting, queues)
- Building e-commerce platforms or content management systems
- Need excellent package ecosystem and community support
- Working on projects requiring strong security features and CSRF protection

### ‚ùå **Avoid Laravel When**

- Building simple static websites that don't need dynamic functionality
- Performance is absolutely critical and framework overhead is unacceptable
- Team lacks PHP experience or strongly prefers other languages
- Building microservices where lighter frameworks might be more appropriate
- Working with legacy PHP codebases that can't be modernized
- Need extremely fine-grained control over every aspect of the application
- Building real-time applications where Node.js might be more suitable
